## Postcards from your Adventurer by Isabella Welch

#Steppe

 fund_inspiration.6001.t: "The Steppe and saddle gallop through my heart,"
 fund_inspiration.6001.desc: "I have been riding for months on end. My rear shall never recover! I've acquired quite the taste for fermented mare's milk and nights beneath the open sky.\n\nWith this courier, I send a carved tip of a Morin Khuur — the decorative horse head placed atop instruments. Perhaps you have a use for it."
 fund_inspiration.6001.a: "I'll hold onto this!"
 fund_inspiration.6001.b: "Send it to the Court Musician."

#India

 fund_inspiration.6002.t: "My jaunt through India marches on!"
 fund_inspiration.6002.desc: "I am near-blinded by all the gems the courts I visit have to show me. I find myself yearning for the filth of the open road.\n\nI have sent a courier with a particularly tasteless gift I was given — a tiger's head ornament on a ring, with jewels for eyes. Have you ever seen something so garish?"
 fund_inspiration.6002.a: "I rather like it, it's his loss."
 fund_inspiration.6002.b: "Ghastly! Take it apart and sell the gems."

#Africa

 fund_inspiration.6003.t: "I dream of the desert,"
 fund_inspiration.6003.desc: "My liege, my journey to Africa is underway, and I have joined a camel train traversing the width of the land.\n\nI send to you a piece of jewelry one of my fellow travelers granted me — a most delicate necklace covered in ostrich shell beads. I suppose you haven't seen an ostrich."
 fund_inspiration.6003.a: "A fine find! I will wear it myself."
 fund_inspiration.6003.b: "I shall give it to [event_spouse.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')]."

#Middle East

 fund_inspiration.6004.t: "Ah, to be a pilgrim,"
 fund_inspiration.6004.desc: "My journey through the Middle East has mostly involved fighting off hoards of peddlers on the pilgrim-paths.\n\nOft, in order not to delay my quest over-long, I give in and buy one of their little trinkets. I have sent a courier bearing the tat your way. Perhaps it shall provide some amusement."
 fund_inspiration.6004.a: "What use is an adventurer who takes the common path?"
 fund_inspiration.6004.b: "These are some pretty baubles..."

#Europe

 fund_inspiration.6005.t: "My adventures are sodden,"
 fund_inspiration.6005.desc: "My Lord, I have found a few trite relics so far in my adventures, which I have sent with this courier, but I am unsure what I may uncover next.\n\nThe Europeans are the smelliest creatures I have encountered. As a child, I dreamt of the green and pleasant meadows, but I am convinced half of this world is made of mud. If you are a gracious liege, please send word to call me back."
 fund_inspiration.6005.a: "This isn't a holiday! Quest on!"
 fund_inspiration.6005.b: "Poor soul, I suppose these rewards shall suffice."
 fund_inspiration.6005.b.tt: "You permit [inspiration_owner.Custom('TitledFirstName')] to return home"

#Asia minor

 fund_inspiration.6006.t: "Greetings from Anatolia,"
 fund_inspiration.6006.desc: "My travels throughout Asia Minor have left me with quite a taste for lamb, yogurt and eggplants, and I have sent some recipes along with this courier.\n\nI have been given a golden brooch adorned with a seahorse by one of my hosts, which I also send to you. I'm certain my travels will bring further wonders in due time."
 fund_inspiration.6006.a: "Order our chefs to prepare these dishes at once!"
