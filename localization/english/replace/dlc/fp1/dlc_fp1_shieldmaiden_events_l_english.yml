 fp1_shieldmaiden.0001.t: "A Prospective [shieldmaiden.Custom('ShieldPersonFemaleMale')]"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0001.desc: ""My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], I come before you asking a chance to prove myself", says my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('shieldmaiden'))], [shieldmaiden.Custom('TitledFirstName')]. I shift a little in my throne, intrigued, while the court around us strains to listen.\n\n"Despite being the equal of any of your $knight_culture_player_plural_no_tooltip_lowercase$, I am forbidden from taking up a place in your shield wall or commanding your troops. I would challenge [challenged_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] to a duel, to show my mettle in combat.""
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0001.a: "Very well, you may duel [challenged_knight.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')]."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0001.a.tt_success: "[challenged_knight.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] triumphs"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0001.a.tt_failure: "[shieldmaiden.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] is victorious"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0001.b: "[challenged_knight.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]? Oh no, you shall fight #EMP me#!!"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0001.b.tt_success: "You defeat [shieldmaiden.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0001.b.tt_failure: "[shieldmaiden.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] sends you reeling"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0001.c: "The asking alone is courage enough."
 fp1_accepted_shieldmaiden_without_question: "Every [courtier|E] & [vassal|E] who thinks [shieldmaiden.GetWomenMen] can't fight"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0001.d: "A [shieldmaiden.Custom('ShieldPersonFemaleMale')]? Laughable!"

 fp1_shieldmaiden.0011.t: "[shieldmaiden.Custom('ShieldPersonFemaleMale')] Blocks Escape"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0011.desc: "Picking my cell's lock proves to be easier than expected. Slipping past guard after guard is harder, but I manage it, creeping like a shadow away from my prison.\n\nIt's not till I can practically #EMP taste#! freedom that it's snatched away from me. Rounding a corner, [shieldmaiden.Custom('TitledFirstName')], [imprisoner.Custom('FirstNamePossessive')] [shieldmaiden.Custom('ShieldPersonFemaleMale')|L] melts out of the darkness.\n\nI don't even register [shieldmaiden.GetHerHis] club till it's swinging right for my face."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0011.a: "Wait, no, don— ARRGH!"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0012.t: "$fp1_shieldmaiden.0011.t$"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0012.desc: "[prisoner.Custom('TitledFirstName')] was returned to confinement in the small hours of this morning, having almost successfully escaped in the night.\n\nThe prisoner stole past most of the guards, it seems, before being noticed by [shieldmaiden.Custom('TitledFirstName')], out for a restless late-night walk.\n\nMy [shieldmaiden.Custom('ShieldPersonFemaleMale')] proceeded to beat [prisoner.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] bloody, only eventually hauling [prisoner.GetHerHim] back to [prisoner.GetHerHis] jailers."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0012.a: "Excellent work, [shieldmaiden.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0012.b: "Why would you beat [prisoner.GetHerHim] so hard?!"

 fp1_shieldmaiden.0021.t: "$murder_save_header$ [shieldmaiden.Custom('ShieldPersonFemaleMale')]"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0021.desc.assassin: "My assassin failed to kill [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')]! Apparently [target.Custom('FirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] [shieldmaiden.Custom('ShieldPersonFemaleMale')] [shieldmaiden.Custom('TitledFirstName')] intervened, appearing seconds before the murder would have taken place and dispatching my hired killer."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0021.desc.thugs: "The thugs I hired to kill [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] have failed in their mission! Despite their viciousness, [target.Custom('FirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] [shieldmaiden.Custom('ShieldPersonFemaleMale')] was able to keep [target.GetHerHim] from harm long enough that [target.GetHerHis] guards were able to rally and dispatch the remaining brigands."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0021.desc.mob: "While the mob I incited to kill [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] managed to drag [target.GetHerHim] off [target.GetHerHis] horse, they were unable to finish the job before [target.Custom('FirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] [shieldmaiden.Custom('ShieldPersonFemaleMale')] intervened. [shieldmaiden.GetSheHe|U] mercilessly dispatched the peasants within striking range of [target.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] and scared the others into fleeing."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0021.desc.lured_into_forest: "I had thought my plan to get [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] lost in the forest had gone perfectly when nightfall came without a sign of the wayward [target.Custom('GirlBoy')].\n\nUnfortunately, right as I was about to go to bed I got news that [target.Custom('FirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] [shieldmaiden.Custom('ShieldPersonFemaleMale')] emerged from the woods with the [target.Custom('GirlBoy')] in tow. Apparently [shieldmaiden.GetSheHe] took it upon [shieldmaiden.GetHerselfHimself] to track [target.Custom('FirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] trail through the woods and found him just before the hungry animals did."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0021.desc.child_pushed: "The silly little [target.Custom('GirlBoy')] who would be [target.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')] was stupid enough to fall into my trap! [target.Custom('FirstName')] climbed up to the balcony edge just as planned, and my agent pushed [target.GetHerHim] off into the open air...\n\n..But what should have been a lethal fall wasn't, when [target.GetSheHe] was caught by [target.GetHerHis] [shieldmaiden.Custom('ShieldPersonFemaleMale')] just before hitting the ground. [target.GetSheHe|U] lives to see another day, and is unlikely to fall for that ploy again."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0021.shieldmaiden_dies: "\n\nAt the very least, [shieldmaiden.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] won't trouble me again, as [shieldmaiden.GetSheHe] has died from [shieldmaiden.GetHerHis] wounds."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0021.a: "It's over..."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0021.b: "... It's not over till I say it's over!"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0022.t: "$murder_save_header$ [shieldmaiden.Custom('ShieldPersonFemaleMale')]"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0022.desc.assassin: "I almost #EMP died#! today! Had [shieldmaiden.Custom('FirstName')] not noticed something amiss and followed me to my quarters, I'd be a corpse by now.\n\nThe first thing I heard of the assassin was [shieldmaiden.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] bodily tackling someone to the ground immediately behind me, and then it was all a blur of knives and fists till the assailant lay dead."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0022.desc.assassin.shieldmaiden_dies: "\n\nSadly, [shieldmaiden.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] paid the ultimate price. Though the assassin is dead, [shieldmaiden.GetHerHis] wounds proved fatal."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0022.desc.thugs: "I am traveling with my retinue when a shout comes from a copse of trees. "Attack! Go for the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleTierName')]!" An ambush!\n\nThese are no mere bandits after my gold, but thugs after my life! My [shieldmaiden.Custom('ShieldPersonFemaleMale')] [shieldmaiden.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] rushes to my defense, placing [shieldmaiden.GetHerHis] body between the bloodthirsty bandits and myself.\n\n[shieldmaiden.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')|U] stages a fighting retreat as my foes converge on our position with blades swinging, but soon my other guards are able to rally to our defense and cut down the remaining attackers."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0022.desc.thugs.shieldmaiden_dies: "It is only when the fighting has subsided that [shieldmaiden.GetSheHe] slumps to the ground, and I discover [shieldmaiden.GetHerHis] deep wounds. [shieldmaiden.GetSheHe] truly protected me until the very last..."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0022.desc.mob: "I am riding through the streets of [home_province.GetName] when a mob of screaming and shouting peasants descends on my retinue. Before I realize what is happening, the commoners tear me from my horse and start beating me!\n\nMy [shieldmaiden.Custom('ShieldPersonFemaleMale')] [shieldmaiden.Custom('FirstName')] rushes to my defense with [shieldmaiden.Custom('signature_weapon')] in hand, mercilessly [shieldmaiden.Custom('SignatureWeaponWoundVerb1PresentParticiple')] at the peasants who were striking me and, perhaps inglamorously, protecting me from further harm as I get buried underneath their corpses."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0022.desc.mob.shieldmaiden_lives: "\n\nAfter the sounds of fighting cease [shieldmaiden.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] rolls the bodies off of me and helps me to my feet. Apart from us the street is now deserted, all of the conspirators dead or fled."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0022.desc.mob.shieldmaiden_dies: "\n\nBy the time I extract myself from the corpse-pile, the street is deserted except for the bodies of the fallen — [shieldmaiden.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] among them."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0022.desc.lured_into_forest: "I was playing hide-and-seek with some courtiers in the woods when I realize it has been a very long time since I have heard anyone looking for me. Too long.\n\nI call out, but hear nothing. I've been abandoned... I try to find my way home, but I do not know which way is which, and it gets dark fast.\n\nSoon I can hear the beasts moving among the trees, but before they can reach me my [shieldmaiden.Custom('ShieldPersonFemaleMale')] [shieldmaiden.Custom('FirstName')] is there, out of breath and brandishing a flaming torch. The fire seems to deter the beasts, who keep their distance as [shieldmaiden.GetSheHe] pants "Let's get... you home... my liege...""
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0022.desc.child_pushed: "\n\n#EMP WHUMP#!\n\nI have fallen into the arms of my [shieldmaiden.Custom('ShieldPersonFemaleMale')], [shieldmaiden.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]. "Foolish child! If I hadn't gotten to you in time... never mind. Let us get you somewhere safe.""
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0022.owner_discovered: "\n\nOnly one person could be possibly be responsible for this attack: [owner.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroductionNoComma', ROOT.Char)]!"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0022.a: "Who would want to have #EMP me#! killed?"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0022.b: "[owner.GetSheHe|U] will suffer for this!"

 fp1_shieldmaiden.0032.t: "[shieldmaiden.Custom('ShieldPersonFemaleMale')] Gains Experience"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0032.desc.root: "Between wars, it's important to keep your skills sharp.\n\nThis policy is what finds me down at the training field, brutally beating, brawling, and berating my soldiers in my third mock battle of the day.\n\nThey moan when I call them back together for the fourth. Let them moan all they like: I have training to do."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0032.desc.courtier: "Watching [shieldmaiden.Custom('TitledFirstName')] training is always an experience. [shieldmaiden.GetSheHe|U] fights with such ferocity, such fury, that it's easy to forget [shieldmaiden.GetSheHe] is only mock-skirmishing.\n\nBroken equipment and battered soldiers litter the field. A lull in the action sends a chorus of relieved moans up from [shieldmaiden.GetHerHis] weakened sparring partners.\n\nBut, almost like that, the break is over, and [shieldmaiden.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] is back at it."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0032.a.root: "My shield wall is unbreakable!"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0032.a.courtier: "See how [shieldmaiden.GetSheHe] commands that shield wall!"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0032.b.root: "I swing as hard as [shieldmaiden.GetFaith.WarGodName]!"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0032.b.courtier: "Look at [shieldmaiden.GetHerHim] swing [shieldmaiden.GetHerHis] blade!"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0032.c.root: "I see every weakness in my foes!"
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0032.c.courtier: "[shieldmaiden.GetSheHe|U] always manages to find an opening!"
