 fp1_shieldmaiden.0011.desc:0 "Picking my cell's lock proves to be easier than expected. Slipping past guard after guard is harder, but I manage it, creeping like a shadow away from my prison.\n\nIt's not till I can practically #EMP taste#! freedom that it's snatched away from me. Rounding a corner, [shieldmaiden.Custom('TitledFirstName')], [imprisoner.Custom('FirstNamePossessive')] [shieldmaiden.Custom('ShieldPersonFemaleMale')|L] melts out of the darkness.\n\nI don't even register [shieldmaiden.GetHerHis] club till it's swinging right for my face."

 fp1_shieldmaiden.0012.desc:0 "[prisoner.Custom('TitledFirstName')] was returned to confinement in the small hours of this morning, having almost successfully escaped in the night.\n\nThe prisoner stole past most of the guards, it seems, before being noticed by [shieldmaiden.Custom('TitledFirstName')], out for a restless late-night walk.\n\nMy [shieldmaiden.Custom('ShieldPersonFemaleMale')] proceeded to beat [prisoner.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] bloody, only eventually hauling [prisoner.GetHerHim] back to [prisoner.GetHerHis] jailers."

[shieldmaiden.GetSheHe|U] mercilessly dispatched the peasants within striking range of [target.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] and scared the others into fleeing."
 fp1_shieldmaiden.0021.desc.lured_into_forest:0 "I had thought my plan to get [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] lost in the forest had gone perfectly when nightfall came without a sign of the wayward [target.Custom('GirlBoy')].\n\nUnfortunately, right as I was about to go to bed I got news that [target.Custom('FirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] [shieldmaiden.Custom('ShieldPersonFemaleMale')] emerged from the woods with the [target.Custom('GirlBoy')] in tow.

The fire seems to deter the beasts, who keep their distance as [shieldmaiden.GetSheHe] pants "Let's get... you home... my liege...""

[shieldmaiden.GetSheHe|U] fights with such ferocity, such fury, that it's easy to forget [shieldmaiden.GetSheHe] is only mock-skirmishing.\n\nBroken equipment and battered soldiers litter the field. A lull in the action sends a chorus of relieved moans up from [shieldmaiden.GetHerHis] weakened sparring partners.\n\nBut, almost like that, the break is over, and [shieldmaiden.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] is back at it."
