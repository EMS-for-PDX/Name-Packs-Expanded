 fp1_trade_events.0002.b:0 "A truce with the ruling [county.GetHolder.GetTopLiege.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')] could be invaluable..."

 fp1_trade_events.0003.desc:0 "A disorderly horde of bandits, pirates, and other heavily-armed scoundrels has entered [county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], led by [raider.Custom('FirstName')]!\n\nAt first, my scouts thought them here to pillage, but an emissary from their [raider.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')] claims that they would happily trade instead. Their force is rich in plunder, new and old, and this would give the locals a chance to buy exotic goods from across the world.\n\nThe subtext is clear. Trade under preferable terms and they will depart in peace, or reject their offer and they will take what they wish."

 fp1_trade_events.0011.desc.outro:0 "now, I have had an understanding with [recipient.Custom('TitledFirstName')]. My raiders keep their weapons in their belts in [recipient.GetHerHis] lands, and [recipient.GetHerHis] subjects buy the exotic luxuries we take from less diplomatic realms.\n\nThe terms of our agreement have almost run their course, though, and many among my retinue are reluctant to give up their convenient trade contacts.\n\nPerhaps [recipient.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] would be open to an extension?"

 fp1_trade_events.0012.desc.outro:0 "my agreement with [raider.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has stood firm: [raider.GetSheHe] keeps [raider.GetHerHis] dogs leashed in my lands, and my merchants buy the loot [raider.GetSheHe] steals from elsewhere.\n\nWith the impending approach of the agreement's end, [raider.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] has reached out to inquire about an extension.\n\nPrivately, several of [raider.GetHerHis] wealthier warriors have offered choice gifts should I keep giving them such free access to our markets, and it #EMP is#! nice not having to worry about angry [raider.GetPrimaryTitle.GetAdjectiveNoTooltip] raiders pillaging the countryside..."

 fp1_trade_events.0021.desc:0 "My trade agreement with [partner.Custom('TitledFirstName')] ensures a steady flow of my merchants and petty nobility visit [partner.GetHerHis] lands, flogging their loot and importing foreign luxuries.\n\nDecidedly less common is an expedition from [partner.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier] making its way to [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier], often something of an event in [ROOT.Char.GetCapitalLocation.GetTitle.GetNameNoTier]. It can be rare to see so many distant foreigners with hands unbound.\n\nThe leaders of such an expedition have managed to garner an audience to beg for patronage: an eloquent [priest.GetFaith.PriestNeuter] and a keen-minded merchant."

 fp1_trade_events.0021.b:0 "Welcome to my service, [priest.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]!"

 fp1_trade_events.0021.d:0 "Move along, foreigners, my agreement is with [partner.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]."

 fp1_trade_events.0031.desc:0 "The raiders of [raider.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')] are a fearsome bunch, enough that I'm often thankful that we count each other as cautious friends rather than bloody enemies.\n\nOne of the more #EMP vicious#! of [raider.GetHerHis] minor terrors counted among their number is [warrior.Custom('FirstName')], a reaver of no small repute.\n\nWhen [warrior.GetSheHe] asked for an audience, I was half-expecting an assassination attempt, but am #EMP pleasantly#! surprised to find the ambitious young warrior wishes to offer [warrior.GetHerHis] services."

 fp1_trade_events.0041.desc:0 "My arrangement with [partner.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is a mutually beneficial one, yet I sometimes wonder if it is living up to its potential. My lands could use the touch of [partner.GetHerHis] veteran masons and carpenters, and though [partner.GetSheHe] is safe from my raiders, many others have no such arrangement.\n\nWith a little joint spending to facilitate the  transit of our servants, we could solve both of these problems together: [partner.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] sends skilled craftspeople to serve me for a time, and in return, I loan [partner.GetHerHim] elderly raiders and eager settlers as advisers to help keep [partner.GetHerHis] lands safe."

 fp1_trade_events.0051.desc:0 "My sometime-trading partner, [raider.Custom('TitledFirstName')], has sent word of an intriguing offer. Though it's true that my lands are safe from [raider.GetHerHis] raiders, the same is not true of many other villains and vagrants, while [raider.GetHerHis] lands are poor and underdeveloped.\n\nWere we both to front the travel costs for our servants, [raider.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] suggests an exchange program of sorts: veteran warriors and settlers from [raider.GetHerHis] lands will be sent to help protect one of my vulnerable frontiers from less tactile thieves, and skilled masons and carpenters from my realm will serve a tour in [raider.GetHerHis] domain."

 fp1_trade_events.1131.desc:0 "A horde of disjointed pirates, landless freemen, desperate lesser children and other assorted miscreants have joined [attacker.Custom('FirstName')] in [attacker.GetHerHis] proposed assault against my holdings.\n\nAlthough the size of the force is formidable, they lack discipline or loyalty, with each scrounged mercenary focused exclusively on what they can get out of the war first and foremost.\n\nUnlike a conventional foe, it might be possible to simply deal directly with the invaders. Perhaps a bargain could be struck..."

 fp1_trade_events.1171.desc:0 "Despite starting under #EMP unusual#! circumstances, my relationship with [partner.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has only grown stronger with time.\n\nStronger, it seems, than I'd imagined, as [partner.GetHerHis] last letter expressed a sincere concern for the fate of my soul.\n\nIn an effort to entice me to convert to [partner.GetFaith.GetName], [partner.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] is offering the hand of [partner.GetHerHis] [prospective_spouse.Custom('GetDaughterSon')], a grand ceremony to welcome me into the faith, #EMP and#! a handsome dowry."
