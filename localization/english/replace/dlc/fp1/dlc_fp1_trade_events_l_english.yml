 fp1_trade_events.0002.t: "$fp1_trade_events.0000.t$?"
 fp1_trade_events.0002.desc: "As my troops and I prepare to sack the lands of [county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], our first scouts report back.\n\nIt seems the local towns are rich, but many are heavily fortified, and we could well be caught out by vengeful armies before we can break into the juiciest targets.\n\nAll is not lost: the art of good raiding is all in exploiting opportunity, and we could perhaps arrange trade and tribute in exchange for staying our blades."
 fp1_trade_events.0002.a: "Perhaps the local [county.GetHolder.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')] will be amenable?"
 fp1_trade_events.0002.a.accepted: "If your offer is accepted"
 fp1_trade_events.0002.a.rejected: "If your offer is rejected"
 fp1_trade_events.0002.a.tt: "You continue raiding [county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]"
 fp1_trade_events.0002.b: "A truce with the ruling [county.GetHolder.GetTopLiege.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')] could be invaluable..."
 fp1_trade_events.0002.c: "Yes, we probably #EMP could#! make money trading. Pillage it anyway."
 fp1_trade_events.0002.c.tt: "$fp1_trade_events.0002.a.tt$"
 fp1_trade_events.0002.d: "What kind of lily-livered #EMP feudal#! coward makes money without raiding?"
 fp1_trade_events.0002.d.tt: "You pillage [county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] and refuse to think about trading instead of raiding for the rest of your life"

 fp1_trade_events.0003.t: "$fp1_trade_events.0000.t$?"
 fp1_trade_events.0003.desc: "A disorderly horde of bandits, pirates, and other heavily-armed scoundrels has entered [county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], led by [raider.Custom('FirstName')]!\n\nAt first, my scouts thought them here to pillage, but an emissary from their [raider.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')] claims that they would happily trade instead. Their force is rich in plunder, new and old, and this would give the locals a chance to buy exotic goods from across the world.\n\nThe subtext is clear. Trade under preferable terms and they will depart in peace, or reject their offer and they will take what they wish."
 fp1_trade_events.0003.a: "An unexpected offer, but highly welcome."
 fp1_trade_events.0003.a.tt_success: "Your offer is accepted!"
 fp1_trade_events.0003.b: "#EMP Trade#!? With these brigands?!"

 fp1_trade_events.0011.desc.outro: "now, I have had an understanding with [recipient.Custom('TitledFirstName')]. My raiders keep their weapons in their belts in [recipient.GetHerHis] lands, and [recipient.GetHerHis] subjects buy the exotic luxuries we take from less diplomatic realms.\n\nThe terms of our agreement have almost run their course, though, and many among my retinue are reluctant to give up their convenient trade contacts.\n\nPerhaps [recipient.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] would be open to an extension?"
 fp1_trade_events.0011.a: "A grand offer!"
 fp1_trade_events.0011.a.accepted: "Your offer is accepted"

 fp1_trade_events.0012.desc.outro: "my agreement with [raider.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has stood firm: [raider.GetSheHe] keeps [raider.GetHerHis] dogs leashed in my lands, and my merchants buy the loot [raider.GetSheHe] steals from elsewhere.\n\nWith the impending approach of the agreement's end, [raider.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] has reached out to inquire about an extension.\n\nPrivately, several of [raider.GetHerHis] wealthier warriors have offered choice gifts should I keep giving them such free access to our markets, and it #EMP is#! nice not having to worry about angry [raider.GetPrimaryTitle.GetAdjectiveNoTooltip] raiders pillaging the countryside..."
 fp1_trade_events.0012.a: "A most agreeable proposal!"

 fp1_trade_events.0021.desc: "My trade agreement with [partner.Custom('TitledFirstName')] ensures a steady flow of my merchants and petty nobility visit [partner.GetHerHis] lands, flogging their loot and importing foreign luxuries.\n\nDecidedly less common is an expedition from [partner.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier] making its way to [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier], often something of an event in [ROOT.Char.GetCapitalLocation.GetTitle.GetNameNoTier]. It can be rare to see so many distant foreigners with hands unbound.\n\nThe leaders of such an expedition have managed to garner an audience to beg for patronage: an eloquent [priest.GetFaith.PriestNeuter] and a keen-minded merchant."
 fp1_trade_events.0021.a: "I could use someone to count my coin..."
 fp1_trade_events.0021.b: "Welcome to my service, [priest.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]!"
 fp1_trade_events.0021.c: "And who is that accompanying you at the back?"

 fp1_trade_events.0031.t: "$fp1_trade_events.0021.t$"
 fp1_trade_events.0031.desc: "The raiders of [raider.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')] are a fearsome bunch, enough that I'm often thankful that we count each other as cautious friends rather than bloody enemies.\n\nOne of the more #EMP vicious#! of [raider.GetHerHis] minor terrors counted among their number is [warrior.Custom('FirstName')], a reaver of no small repute.\n\nWhen [warrior.GetSheHe] asked for an audience, I was half-expecting an assassination attempt, but am #EMP pleasantly#! surprised to find the ambitious young warrior wishes to offer [warrior.GetHerHis] services."
 fp1_trade_events.0031.a: "The swords[warrior.GetWomenMen] of [raider.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] are legendary!"
 fp1_trade_events.0031.b: "Be gone, bandit."

 fp1_trade_events.0041.t: "$fp1_trade_events.0000.t$: Belligerents with Benefits"
 fp1_trade_events.0041.desc: "My arrangement with [partner.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is a mutually beneficial one, yet I sometimes wonder if it is living up to its potential. My lands could use the touch of [partner.GetHerHis] veteran masons and carpenters, and though [partner.GetSheHe] is safe from my raiders, many others have no such arrangement.\n\nWith a little joint spending to facilitate the  transit of our servants, we could solve both of these problems together: [partner.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] sends skilled craftspeople to serve me for a time, and in return, I loan [partner.GetHerHim] elderly raiders and eager settlers as advisers to help keep [partner.GetHerHis] lands safe."

 fp1_trade_events.0051.t: "$fp1_trade_events.0041.t$"
 fp1_trade_events.0051.desc: "My sometime-trading partner, [raider.Custom('TitledFirstName')], has sent word of an intriguing offer. Though it's true that my lands are safe from [raider.GetHerHis] raiders, the same is not true of many other villains and vagrants, while [raider.GetHerHis] lands are poor and underdeveloped.\n\nWere we both to front the travel costs for our servants, [raider.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] suggests an exchange program of sorts: veteran warriors and settlers from [raider.GetHerHis] lands will be sent to help protect one of my vulnerable frontiers from less tactile thieves, and skilled masons and carpenters from my realm will serve a tour in [raider.GetHerHis] domain."

 fp1_trade_events.0051.d: "What an outrageous proposal!"

 # Special Trade Events
 fp1_trade_events.1131.t: "The Northerner Menace"
 fp1_trade_events.1131.desc: "A horde of disjointed pirates, landless freemen, desperate lesser children and other assorted miscreants have joined [attacker.Custom('FirstName')] in [attacker.GetHerHis] proposed assault against my holdings.\n\nAlthough the size of the force is formidable, they lack discipline or loyalty, with each scrounged mercenary focused exclusively on what they can get out of the war first and foremost.\n\nUnlike a conventional foe, it might be possible to simply deal directly with the invaders. Perhaps a bargain could be struck..."
 fp1_trade_events.1131.a: "Never! Back to your frozen hellscape of a home, scum!"
 fp1_trade_events.1131.b: "If it's land they want, why not give it to them?"

 fp1_trade_events.1131.c.tt: "You pay a gafol directly to [attacker.Custom('FirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] troops to have them disband"
 fp1_trade_events.1131.d: "We'll banish these invaders as we've always done."
 fp1_trade_events.1131.d.tt: "You fight the Nords the old-fashioned way"

 fp1_trade_events.1171.t: "$fp1_trade_events.0000.t$: A Holy Helping Hand"
 fp1_trade_events.1171.desc: "Despite starting under #EMP unusual#! circumstances, my relationship with [partner.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has only grown stronger with time.\n\nStronger, it seems, than I'd imagined, as [partner.GetHerHis] last letter expressed a sincere concern for the fate of my soul.\n\nIn an effort to entice me to convert to [partner.GetFaith.GetName], [partner.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] is offering the hand of [partner.GetHerHis] [prospective_spouse.Custom('GetDaughterSon')], a grand ceremony to welcome me into the faith, #EMP and#! a handsome dowry."
 fp1_trade_events.1171.a: "[partner.GetSheHe|U] #EMP does#! make quite a compelling case..."
 fp1_trade_events.1171.b: "What a gesture! To ever-lasting friendship!"
 fp1_trade_events.1171.b.tt: "All of the above effects, as well as..."
