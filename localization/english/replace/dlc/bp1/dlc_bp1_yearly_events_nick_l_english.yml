 bp1_yearly.5001.desc: "Why have I woken? Blearily, my sleep-addled brain goes through a mental checklist. The night is cold but not freezing, my bed is warm and comfortable, and-\n\nThere is a silhouette at the foot of my bed. As it approaches, it coalesces into the form of my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', sibling_murderer)] [sibling_murderer.Custom('FirstName')]. I open my mouth to point out that [sibling_murderer.GetHerHis] room is actually the next one along from mine when I notice the pillow in [sibling_murderer.GetHerHis] hands.\n\nIt is only thanks to the the livid glow of moonlight that I can see the wild, deranged, murderous glint in [sibling_murderer.GetHerHis] eyes."

 bp1_yearly.5002.desc: "[sibling_murderer.Custom('FirstName')] dives at me as soon as [sibling_murderer.GetSheHe] sees me move, but the sudden rush of adrenaline gives me strength. [sibling_murderer.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] is intercepted halfway across the bed, my fist catching [sibling_murderer.GetHerHim] right in the jaw.\n\n[sibling_murderer.GetSheHe|U] staggers back limply, and the subsequent disorientated blows that rain down can’t stop me from tackling them to the ground. Seated firmly astride [sibling_murderer.GetHerHis] chest, a brutal strike shatters [sibling_murderer.Custom('FirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] nose and bounces [sibling_murderer.GetHerHis] head off the flagstone floor, reducing [sibling_murderer.GetHerHis] fiery resistance to pathetic mewling.\n\nIt is in this position that [guard.Custom('FirstName')] — thankfully quick on the uptake — finds me in. [sibling_murderer.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] stares at the ground sullenly as I explain what happened."

 bp1_yearly.5004.desc: "[sibling_murderer.Custom('FirstName')] springs forward, covering the space between [sibling_murderer.GetHerHim] and the head of my bed in the blink of an eye, but it’s too late. My cry for help was already halfway out of my throat by the time [sibling_murderer.GetSheHe] even moved, and even as the pillow stifled it the thunder of a pair of fast-approaching feet is already audible."
 bp1_yearly.5004.guard.death: "\n\nThe door clatters open and there, blessedly, stands [guard.Custom('FirstName')]. [guard.GetSheHe|U] gasps and turns to shout, only to be silenced as my [sibling_murderer.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', ROOT.Char)] hisses [guard.GetHerHis] name. I can only listen in rising horror as [sibling_murderer.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] swiftly barters for [guard.Custom('FirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] silence and loyalty.\n\nOverwhelming, cresting waves of panic rise in my chest when the footsteps shuffle once more, punctuated with the door latch’s final, dreadful #EMP click.#!"

[guard.GetSheHe|U] gasps and shouts back over [guard.GetHerHis] shoulder, through the open door. Moments later, two guards storm in, lifting my would-be murderer off [sibling_murderer.GetHersHis] feet and away from me. \n\nFor [sibling_murderer.GetHersHis] part, [sibling_murderer.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] gazes sullenly at the floor, unable or unwilling to even try denying [sibling_murderer.GetHerHis] actions."

 bp1_yearly.5008.desc: "[sibling_murderer.Custom('FirstName')] is quick, but it's instantly clear that [sibling_murderer.GetSheHe] has fatally underestimated me. [sibling_murderer.GetSheHe|U] leaps across the room but I am already out of bed and moving, and [sibling_murderer.Custom('FirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] momentum betrays [sibling_murderer.GetHerHim] as [sibling_murderer.GetSheHe] trips over an uneven flagstone and is sent sprawling.\n\nOne step forward and my foot catches [sibling_murderer.GetHerHim] scrambling to [sibling_murderer.GetHerHis] knees, rebounding [sibling_murderer.GetHerHis] skull off the wall with a sickening crack. The subsequent blind swing from my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', sibling_murderer)] is wild and off-target, and I use the opportunity to reach my side-table.\n\n[sibling_murderer.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] whips around to find a small, but wickedly sharp, knife at [sibling_murderer.GetHerHis] throat.

 bp1_yearly.5601.bodysnatcher: "Though [bp1_yearly_5601_dead_nemesis.GetSheHe] now can't say a word to stop them, I bridle somewhat at the thought of [bp1_yearly_5601_dead_nemesis.Custom('FirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] family having the temerity to tacitly defend [bp1_yearly_5601_dead_nemesis.GetHerHis] honor.\n\nThe procession passes me by, heading to bury the body."

 bp1_yearly.5602.desc: "The night air hangs still and silent. The only noise that can be heard is the scrape of my shovel, dislodging the freshly-heaped dirt with ease. Slowly, the heap beside the grave grows larger, and the body of [bp1_yearly_5601_dead_nemesis.Custom('FirstName')] is exposed once again to the fresh air it had been parted from all too recently.\n\nI rip the cloth covering off [bp1_yearly_5601_dead_nemesis.GetHerHis] face.

 bp1_yearly.5702.stewardship: "To say that [skilful_friend.GetSheHe] has a mind for money would be an understatement.

 bp1_yearly.5702.intrigue: "Of all the people I would hate to have as a foe, [skilful_friend.Custom('FirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] is surely somewhere near the top of the list.

I acquiesce, my hands folded above my head as I bathe in the post-coital glow. My wrists suddenly feeling the cold steel of manacles around them causes my eyes to snap back open, to see my lover clambering over to the bedside table.\n\n”I’ve been waiting for this a long, long time.” [rival_lover.GetSheHe] hisses.
