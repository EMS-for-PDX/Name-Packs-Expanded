#HORSE RACES
 jason_race_events.1.t: "The Will of the Crowd"
 jason_race_events.1.desc: "From the vast sea of race-watchers, commoners holler out. Itinerant warriors chant insults, vulgar innuendo. Amidst them, we nobles chuckle nervously. We look to our guards."

 jason_race_events.1.desc.guest_local_anger: "\n\n"[host.Custom('TitledFirstName')]!" is howled, along with terms like “#EMP [host.Custom('GetCrime')|U]!#!” Those raging loudest are the locals: in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName], [host.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] is amidst a people who despise [host.GetHerHim].\n\nGazing across the crowd, I see stones, knives, and the weapons of war."

 jason_race_events.1.desc.host_local_anger: "\n\n"[ROOT.Char.Custom('TitledFirstName')]!" is howled, along with terms like “#EMP [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetCrime')|U]!#!” Those raging loudest are all locals — in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName], I am amidst a people who despise me.\n\nGazing across the crowd, I see stones, knives, and the weapons of war."

 jason_race_events.1.desc.rowdy_fans: "\n\nThe thrill of the race always draws the worst of the realm, in enormous numbers, and riles them with promises of carousing and gambling. \n\nSometimes, on ill-fated days, the usual pleasures just aren't enough: only blood can satisfy."

 jason_race_events.1.desc.end: "\n\nThis is about to be a riot."

 jason_race_events.1.a: "Only I can pacify the crowd."
 jason_race_events.1.a.tt: "With just the right cajoling words, I'll get their attention back to the race."
 jason_race_events.1.a.tt.win: "Your speech calms the people"
 jason_race_events.1.a.tt.race: "The Contest continues uninterrupted"
 jason_race_events.1.a.tt.lose: "You fail to prevent the riot"

 jason_race_events.1.b: "Beat the courage from them, $knights$!"
 jason_race_events.1.b.tt: "And once we've wiped the blood from our eyes, we can resume the race!"

 jason_race_events.1.c: "Perhaps the mob could use a little push..."
 jason_race_events.1.c.tt: "Go, my $knights$ — start some truly devastating violence!"
 jason_race_events.1.c.tt.win: "Your $knights$ quell the mob"
 jason_race_events.1.c.tt.lose: "Your enforcers set off a terrible riot"
 jason_race_events.1.c.tt.lose_knights: "Some of your $knight_culture_player_plural$ are [GetTrait('wounded_1').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]"

 jason_race_events.1.d: "I need to get out of here, #EMP fast#!."
 jason_race_events.1.d.tt: "Who knows? Maybe everything will turn out alright."

 jason_race_events.1.d.tt.win: "The unrest is contained"
 jason_race_events.1.d.tt.lose: "Mob violence spills across the land"

 jason_race_events.1.d.tt.leave: "You and your entourage withdraw to safety."

 contest_wound_attendees_effect: "Many $activity_tournament$-goers are [GetTrait('wounded_1').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]"

 contest_wound_non_root_attendees_effect: "Many other $activity_tournament$-goers are [GetTrait('wounded_1').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]"


 jason_race_events.2.t: "A Turn at Speed"
 jason_race_events.2.desc: "The horses thunder along the track, their coursing bodies obscured by clouds of dust, the cursing and yelling of their jockeys inaudible amidst hoof-beats and the roar of the crowd.\n\nStill, you can tell your rider [jockey.Custom('FirstName')] is utterly focused on a rapidly-approaching turn. As the others slow to take the sharp bend in stride, your rider spurs hard.\n\nWith just a fingers-breadth to spare, [jockey.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] and #EMP [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetContestHorseRaceName')]#! slip between those ahead. An incredible maneuver — the crowd gasps as one!"

 jason_race_events.2.a: "Such skills belong on the battlefield!"
 jason_race_events.2.a.tt: "My cavalrymen should be trained to ride with similar boldness."

 jason_race_events.2.b: "My entourage could use a new scout..."
 jason_race_events.2.b.tt: "Such a daring rider should be ahead of us on every journey."

 jason_race_events.2.c: "A moment worth a thousand tellings!"
 jason_race_events.2.c.tt: "Win or lose, no one else's racers make an impression like mine."
