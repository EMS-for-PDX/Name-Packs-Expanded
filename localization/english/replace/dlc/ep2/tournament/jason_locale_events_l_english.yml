 jason_locale_events.100.t: "[unreliable_knight.GetSheHe|U] Who Spurns the Fight"
 jason_locale_events.100.desc: "My $knight_culture_player_no_tooltip_lowercase$ [unreliable_knight.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] recent absences have not gone unnoticed, nor the many servants turned away from [unreliable_knight.GetHerHis] door. At the tourneyer's request, I enter [unreliable_knight.GetHerHis] lodgings.\n\n"
 jason_locale_events.100.desc.mess: "Spilled libations stain a floor strewn with gnawed delicacies, odd ephemera, upset furniture.\n\n"
 jason_locale_events.100.desc.self_harm: "Gloomy half-light hangs over a floor strewn with rent garments, shattered objects,"
 jason_locale_events.100.desc.smug: "[unreliable_knight.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')] acknowledges me with a scant obeisance, turning [unreliable_knight.GetHerHis] shining sword over and over in [unreliable_knight.GetHerHis] hands.\n\n"
 jason_locale_events.100.desc.insanity: "feathers, feces, and blood.\n\nA severed hand rests at [unreliable_knight.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] feet. Whose? I know not. [unreliable_knight.GetSheHe|U] gesticulates with both of [unreliable_knight.GetHerHis], rattling out:\n\n"More hands will appear, my [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleTierName')|U], more hands. You see? If I am in the contests, more bloody hands appear.""
 jason_locale_events.100.desc.drunk: "Your $knight_culture_player_no_tooltip_lowercase$ is shockingly drunk, still sucking down more wine, and wincing at [unreliable_knight.GetHerHis] evident self-loathing. The sot will be in utter ruin by the morning.\n\n"Must I, must I — #EMP *hic*#! — ride or fight or whatever it was?""
 jason_locale_events.100.desc.hash: "Your $knight_culture_player_no_tooltip_lowercase$ is staggeringly addled, with [unreliable_knight.GetHerHis] breath stinking of hashish. Skin sticky with sweat, [unreliable_knight.Custom('EyeEyes')] narrowly squinting, [unreliable_knight.GetSheHe] giggles and drools out a question:\n\n"Am I, uh, meant to be doing something... in the next lil' while?""
 jason_locale_events.100.desc.depressed: "a $knight_culture_player_no_tooltip_lowercase$'s blood.\n\nTears become red on [unreliable_knight.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] cheeks.\n\n"I can't go out there," sobs your $knight_culture_player_no_tooltip_lowercase$. "I can't face them. Not again — not now. Please, my [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleTierName')|U], #EMP please#!... spare me from the tourney's fray?""
 jason_locale_events.100.desc.demand: ""All the world knows I am a great and worthy $knight_culture_player_no_tooltip_lowercase$," growls [unreliable_knight.GetSheHe]. "And so, without highborn attendants and grand gifts from my liege, I must #EMP refuse#! to compete."\n\n"My attending the contests in poverty would dishonor us both.""

 jason_locale_events.100.a: "You owe me your service, remember?"
 jason_locale_events.100.a.tt: "Perhaps [unreliable_knight.GetSheHe] isn't prepared to give [unreliable_knight.GetHerHis] best, but this $knight_culture_player_no_tooltip_lowercase$ #EMP will#! bend to your authority."

 jason_locale_events.100.b: "Compete! I'll give you anything!"
 jason_locale_events.100.b.tt: "And look after my best $knight_culture_player_plural_no_tooltip_lowercase$, I swear it!"

 jason_locale_events.210.desc.camel_cavalry: ""but all of you lack the will to bring a camel to heel! And even your porcine asses couldn't comfort you in one of our saddles!"\n\nNearby grooms clutch camels' reins: the [foreign_lord.Custom('TitleTierName')]'s challenge is in earnest. Though [foreign_lord.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] terrify horses and rule deserts and drylands atop their beasts... the stink of camels is truly foul."
 jason_locale_events.210.desc.elephant_cavalry: ""but has any [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] warrior the courage to stand atop an elephant in battle — to ply lance and bow while that great trunk sounds in wrath?"\n\nAn elephant's gilded tusks gleam nearby; the howdah upon its back creaks on high. The [foreign_lord.Custom('TitleTierName')] presents a challenge vast and unpredictable."
 jason_locale_events.210.desc.horse_archer: ""but can any among you turn in the saddle, riding full tilt, and loose an arrow over your horse's tail? Can you time this between hoof-beats? The youngest [foreign_lord.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] child can do this."\n\nI see my [ROOT.Char.Custom('KnightCulturePluralNoTooltip')|l] pulling at horn bows, patting steppe ponies. We are fine horsemen... but do we compare to a people born into their saddles..?"
 jason_locale_events.210.desc.heavy_cavalry: ""but who among you has spurred into an enemy line, heedless to all weapons, your charger trampling, your lance striking home? Try my warhorse: let's see if you can unhorse even the worst [foreign_lord.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] rider."\n\nMy people don't employ the tack needed to ride with a heavy lance into battle: this isn't our way. Still, can I suffer such a boast to stand...?"
 jason_locale_events.210.desc.crossbowmen: ""but have you even #EMP seen#! one of these? Could you load one and take aim?"\n\nThe [foreign_lord.Custom('TitleTierName')] passes me a weapon I have, in fact, seen before... from afar. It is a strong bow placed sideways at the end of an arrow-bearing channel: the [foreign_lord.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] use it to pierce armor. Any armor."
 jason_locale_events.210.desc.heavy_infantry: ""you can dart to and fro! But what of holding firm against one of my warriors, weighed down by our heavy kit, until the foe breaks against you?"\n\nMy [ROOT.Char.Custom('KnightCulturePluralNoTooltip')|l] struggle into impressive [foreign_lord.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] armor, hoist [foreign_lord.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] weapons, marvel at their weight. To sweat through such a strange duel... would take impressive grit."

 jason_locale_events.210.b.win: "[root_culture_knight.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] matches [foreign_lord.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] expertise"
 jason_locale_events.210.b.lose: "[root_culture_knight.Custom('FirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] attempts are... rather sad"
 jason_locale_events.210.c: "Can you spare any [foreign_lord.Custom('KnightCultureNoTooltip')|l] to teach us?"

 jason_locale_events.210.d.crossbowmen: "We [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] need no contraptions!"
 jason_locale_events.210.d.tt.crossbowmen: "Like cowards, the [foreign_lord.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip]snuff out the noblest warriors from afar. But we, we shall never."
 jason_locale_events.210.d.heavy_infantry: "We [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] can defend ourselves!"
 jason_locale_events.210.d.tt.heavy_infantry: "Armor? What need have we, when we have skill? The [foreign_lord.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] are heavy like stones: we will bury them beneath the earth."

The drunken $knight_culture_player_no_tooltip_lowercase$ swats them away.\n\n"Unhand me! Damn you all! [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleTierName')] — free me from my tatty master! My oath is yours.
