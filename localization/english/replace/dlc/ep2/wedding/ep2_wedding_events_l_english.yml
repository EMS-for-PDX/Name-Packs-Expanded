 ep2_wedding.0151.desc_diplo: "Behind all the rituals and ceremonies, weddings are first and foremost political events.

 ep2_wedding.0151.desc_seducer: "All wedding ceremonies are the same: an exercise in piling up empty words and promises the highest.

Then, it's my turn to speak up.$ep2_wedding.0151.desc_end$"
