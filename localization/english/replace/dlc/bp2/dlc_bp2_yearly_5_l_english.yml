 bp2_yearly.5006.desc: "As [crusher.Custom('FirstName')] and I chase and play in the garden, I become aware that [crusher.GetSheHe] has wandered to a stop.

 bp2_yearly.5007.desc: "To my infinite relief, [foreign_hostage.Custom('FirstNamePossessive')] face lights up. [foreign_hostage.GetSheHe|U] grins, nodding shyly but enthusiastically.

[foreign_hostage.GetSheHe|U] smiles again.\n\nWe stroll off down the colonnaded garden, hand in hand, oblivious to the world outside of the other. Silently, I wish for the moment to never end."

 bp2_yearly.5008.desc: "To my horror, [foreign_hostage.Custom('FirstNamePossessive')] face splits into an uncertain grimace.\n\n"What do you mean? Why are you being so strange?"

[marry_crush.GetSheHe|U] turns to me.\n\n"When we're older, will we be married?" [marry_crush.GetSheHe|U] asks earnestly. My quizzical expression clearly prompts a follow-up. "When we are both of age, we should surely be married. It is our destiny!"\n\nI consider the possibility quietly. My passions burn so brightly: surely there can be no future for me without [marry_crush.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]?"

 bp2_yearly.5010.desc: ""It's just like old times, isn't it?"\n\nI am broken out of my reverie by [marry_crush.Custom('FirstName')]. [marry_crush.GetSheHe|U] sits [marry_crush.GetHerselfHimself] down beside me, smiling widely. Just having [marry_crush.GetHerHim] in this garden with me truly does bring back memories of when we were both young and embarrassingly devoted to each other.\n\n"Do you remember all that time ago?

[root_crush.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] is a degree more earnest than I had expected. [root_crush.GetSheHe|U] takes my hand in [root_crush.GetHersHis]. "I meant what I said. We are both unwed. I remember how happy we were.""

 bp2_yearly.5012.desc: "[marry_crush.Custom('FirstNamePossessive')] face is unreadable for a few moments, but it quickly resolves itself out to happy surprise.\n\n"Of course I will! Of course!" [marry_crush.GetSheHe|U] flings [marry_crush.GetHerselfHimself] into my arms. For a moment, it is like we are children again, muddling our way through giddy, confusing feelings.\n\nI take [marry_crush.GetHerHis] hand, and we make towards the garden's entrance. There is much to organize, after all."

 bp2_yearly.5013.desc: "[marry_crush.Custom('FirstNamePossessive')] face is unreadable for a few moments, but it quickly resolves itself out to confusion.\n\n"What do you mean?

"Why are you talking about childish old promises?"\n\nI try and formulate the words, but [marry_crush.GetSheHe] is already walking away, shaking [marry_crush.GetHerHis] head dismissively."

 bp2_yearly.5050.desc: "As I wander across the courtyard, a scrap of parchment swirls in the breeze. I catch it, but the strange strokes daubed on to it are unlike anything I've seen before.\n\n"Ah!

Sensing my bemusement, [polyglot.GetSheHe] taps the scrap reassuringly.\n\n"It's of another language, my little [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], don't you worry!

 bp2_yearly.5051.desc: "I can hear it, echoing down the corridor. Light giggles, occasionally breaking out into full peals of laughter.
