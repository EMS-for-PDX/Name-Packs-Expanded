The boar entered the residence of a kind hermit, who refused to let the hunters through; the hunters, filled with bloodlust, and angered that he stood in their way, killed the hermit. The hunters were horrified at what they did in the heat of passion; as the hermit lay dying, he told them [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] would forgive their sin if they and their descendants carry out a ritual every year.\n\nSince then, the people of Whitby perform an annual ritual where they construct a short hedge from stakes woven together. They place it along the river Esk with great ceremony, and must ensure it withstands three tides."

According to local legend, the two rocks used to be one until the giant Rombauld (who once lived in Yorkshire) was fleeing from the wrath of his enemy - his own wife, amusingly enough - and stamped on the rock by accident during the chase, thus splitting the rock in two.\n\nAnyways, it is a beautiful sight, and the rocks are framed most elegantly against the rest of the grasses and the skies."
