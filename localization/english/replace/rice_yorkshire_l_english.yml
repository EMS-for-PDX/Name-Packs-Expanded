 game_concept_saint_john_of_beverley: "Saint John of Beverley"
 game_concept_saint_john_of_beverley_desc: "$game_concept_saint_john_of_beverley$ was the Bishop of York in the early 8th century, who was historically canonized in 1037 and was a widely respected saint in medieval England.\n\nAt the 867 bookmark, Saint John has not been canonized yet. In order for that to happen, a [ruler|E] needs to first take the [decision|E] to #V Pay Homage#! to him. One hundred years after that, another [ruler|E] can take the [decision|E] to #V Secure his Canonization#!.\n\nOnce Saint John has been canonized, or if starting from the 1066 bookmark, [rulers|E] in the region can take a [decision|E] to #V Go on a Pilgrimage to Beverley#! to pay respects to him. If a [king|E] or [emperor|E] who is the [liege|E] of #V East Riding#! does this at least once, they’ll have access to a [decision|E] to #V Borrow the Banner of Saint John#! which can be taken only once in a lifetime but grants a powerful military [character_modifier|E].

 game_concept_charter_fair_desc: "In medieval England, the $game_concept_charter_fair$ was an important privilege granted to some settlements.

Once the charters for all four are granted, a special event will trigger sometime after upgrading their [county_modifiers|E]. Charters can also be granted to Stourbridge in Cambrige, and Scarborough (for the famous fair which inspired the song Scarborough Fair).\n\nCharters can only be granted if you are at least a [duke|E], though the requirements are easier if you are a [king|E] or [emperor|E]. If you are a lower [rank|E], you will need to in the [realm|E] of a [king|E] or [emperor|E] and pay a sizeable amount of [prestige|E] to petition your [top_liege|E] to grant the charter."

He trained many important thinkers of his era, and I feel a little sense of pride at the thought that I rule territories not too far from where he was born and grew up in. Two of his famous sayings, I recall, include:\n\n"Remember to care for the soul more than the body, since the former remains, the latter perishes."\n\n"And do not listen to those who keep saying, 'The voice of the people is the voice of God', because the tumult of the crowd is always close to madness.""

 yorkshire.0107.desc: "The seventh century Anglo-Saxon poet, Caedmon, used to live at [whitby_barony.GetNameNoTier] abbey as a cow-herder and later monk. His most famous work, Caedmon’s Hymn, is being recited to me today by a local poet, before he presents me with a manuscript copy.\n\n#italic Now we must honour the guardian of heaven,#!\n#italic the might of the architect, and his purpose,#!\n#italic the work of the father of glory#!\n#italic as he, the eternal lord, established the origin of every wonder;#!\n#italic he first created for the children of men#!\n#italic heaven as a roof, the holy creator.#!\n#italic Then the guardian of mankind,#!\n#italic the eternal lord, afterwards appointed the middle-enclosure,#!\n#italic the lands for men, the Lord almighty."

 yorkshire.0108.desc: "Saint Guthlac of Crowland is a popular local saint venerated in [lincolnshire_county.GetNameNoTier]. Though his shrine at Crowland abbey has always been popular for local pilgrimages, and reputed for its healing powers, it is seeing more traffic than usual as of late."

 yorkshire.0109.t: "River Swale"
 yorkshire.0109.desc: "For generations, the area around the river Swale in [north_riding_county.GetNameNoTier] - one of the fastest flowing rivers in England - has been a local center for lead mining. There has recently been an economic boom for the lead industry here, as demand for lead has increased in the region."
 yorkshire.0109.a: "Good, good."
 yorkshire.0110.t: "The Penny Hedge"
 yorkshire.0110.desc: "I am listening to a local legend from [whitby_barony.GetNameNoTier] that explains one of the town’s traditions, the #bold Penny Hedge#!. According to legend, three local noblemen were hunting in the nearby woods in pursuit of a boar. The boar entered the residence of a kind hermit, who refused to let the hunters through; the hunters, filled with bloodlust, and angered that he stood in their way, killed the hermit. The hunters were horrified at what they did in the heat of passion; as the hermit lay dying, he told them [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] would forgive their sin if they and their descendants carry out a ritual every year.\n\nSince then, the people of Whitby perform an annual ritual where they construct a short hedge from stakes woven together. They place it along the river Esk with great ceremony, and must ensure it withstands three tides."
 yorkshire.0110.a: "It’s an amusing little story, but I doubt it actually happened."
 yorkshire.0110.b: "A moral tale, and good that the people of [whitby_barony.GetNameNoTier] remember it."
 yorkshire.0111.t: "Cow and Calf"
 yorkshire.0111.desc: "I am passing through [west_riding_county.GetNameNoTier], particularly an area known as #bold Ilkley Moor#!. There is a large rock formation there, called the “Cow and Calf” by locals due to their resemblance to such. According to local legend, the two rocks used to be one until the giant Rombauld (who once lived in Yorkshire) was fleeing from the wrath of his enemy - his own wife, amusingly enough - and stamped on the rock by accident during the chase, thus splitting the rock in two.\n\nAnyways, it is a beautiful sight, and the rocks are framed most elegantly against the rest of the grasses and the skies."
 yorkshire.0111.a: "To think such wonders exist in nature!"
