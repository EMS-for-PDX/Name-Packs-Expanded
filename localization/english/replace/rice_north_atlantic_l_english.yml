 game_concept_RICE_greenland_struggle_desc: "The $game_concept_RICE_greenland_struggle$ is a [struggle|E] that affects the [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_greenland_struggle_region').GetName] [region|E]. It depicts the history of the Norse settlements in [greenland|E], which at one point was an important part of the North Atlantic economy despite being a distant frontier region.\n\nIn start dates after c.980 CE, this [struggle|E] is already present. In earlier start dates, the [struggle|E] is triggered once a [ruler|E] takes the [decision|E] to $RICE_north_atlantic_explore_greenland$.\n\n[rulers|E] [struggle_involved|E] in $game_concept_colonizing_greenland$ have access to a slew of special [decisions|E] and mechanics, such as the ability to hunt walrus in [nordsetur|E] or send [greenland_expeditions|E] to the west. Many of these mechanics are tied to @RICE_greenland_resilience_icon! [greenland_resilience|E] and @RICE_greenland_networks_icon! [greenland_networks|E], two major values that need to be kept high in order for [greenland|E] to prosper, particularly by [greenland_supporting|E] [greenland|E].\n\nThere are four ways this [struggle|E] can end. Three are through ending [decisions|E]: two #P good#! endings which are $RICE_greenland_struggle_ending_integration_decision$ and $RICE_greenland_struggle_ending_indigenous_decision$, and one #N bad#! ending which is to $RICE_greenland_struggle_ending_abandonment_decision$. Additionally, there is a fourth ending, where the colony naturally just fails. This happens gradually if @RICE_greenland_resilience_icon! [greenland_resilience|E] and @RICE_greenland_networks_icon! [greenland_networks|E] are low, and several historical events are triggered in the late game."

 game_concept_nordseturs: "Nordsetur's"
 game_concept_nordsetur: "Nordsetur"
 game_concept_nordsetur_desc: "Nordsetur is a region in northern [greenland|E] that likely corresponds to modern-day Disko Bay, and is home to significant numbers of walrus. As [greenland|E] exported much of walrus ivory used in Europe during much of the medieval period, walrus hunts were an integral part of life and society in the [greenland_colony|E].\n\nIf the [RICE_greenland_struggle|E] is still on-going, or has been resolved with a good ending, [rulers|E] whose [houses|E] have a [greenland_estate_long|E] can take the [decision|E] to $RICE_north_atlantic_hunting_trip$.

 game_concept_vinland: "Vinland"
 game_concept_vinland_desc: "Vinland was the Norse name for a region west of [greenland|E] and south of [markland|E] and [helluland|E], which likely corresponds to modern-day Newfoundland and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, and possibly as far south as Maine in the United States. It can be interacted with once a [ruler|E] who is [struggle_involved|E] in the [RICE_greenland_struggle|E] takes the [decision|E] to $RICE_north_atlantic_explore_vinland$.\n\nDue to its remoteness and the lack of lucrative resources (unlike in [greenland|E]), colonizing Vinland is extremely difficult if the [RICE_greenland_struggle|E] has not been resolved with a good ending. Sending [greenland_expeditions|E] to Vinland is also costly.\n\nThe main global value related to Vinland is @RICE_vinland_viability_icon! [vinland_viability|E], which influences the chances of success when attempting to establish a [vinland_outpost_long|E].If the [RICE_greenland_struggle|E] has a good ending, then [rulers|E] in the [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_greenland_struggle_region').GetName] [region|E] will have access to a [decision|E] to establish a permanent [vinland_colony_long|E]."

It can be interacted with once a [ruler|E] who is [struggle_involved|E] in the [RICE_greenland_struggle|E] takes the [decision|E] to $RICE_north_atlantic_explore_vinland$.\n\nThe main way to interact with Markland is through [greenland_expeditions|E]. The advantage of sending [greenland_expeditions|E] there as opposed to [helluland|E] or [vinland|E] is that you are more likely to trigger [expedition_episodes_long|E] that increase [greenlands|E] @RICE_greenland_resilience_icon! [greenland_resilience|E] in Markland.\n\nHistorically, Markland was noted for its many forests, and Greenlanders may have voyaged there as late as the 14th century to harvest timber."

 game_concept_helluland_desc: "Helluland is the name for a region west of [greenland|E], which likely corresponds to modern-day Baffin Island in Canada. It can be interacted with once a [ruler|E] who is [struggle_involved|E] in the [RICE_greenland_struggle|E] takes the [decision|E] to $RICE_north_atlantic_explore_vinland$.\n\nThe main way to interact with Helluland is through [greenland_expeditions|E]. The advantage of sending [greenland_expeditions|E] there as opposed to [markland|E] or [vinland|E] is that you are more likely to trigger [expedition_episodes_long|E] where you encounter local native peoples, and increase [greenlands|E] @RICE_greenland_networks_icon! [greenland_networks|E].\n\nHistorically, Helluland may have been the site of occasional Norse contact between the local cultures, namely the Dorset and, later on, the Inuit."

It is one of the two global values tied to [greenland|E], alongside @RICE_greenland_networks_icon! [greenland_networks|E].\n\nFor those [struggle_involved|E] in the [RICE_greenland_struggle|E], higher Resilience has positive effects on a number of mechanics and [decisions|E]. In particular, the higher Resilience is, the more [gold|E] and [piety|E] you can get annually from a [greenland_estate_long|E].Additionally, Resilience and [greenland_networks|E] must be at a high level in order to attain a good ending for the [RICE_greenland_struggle|E].\n\nResilience naturally increases or decreases at a somewhat random rate every year depending on the [struggle_phase|E] the [RICE_greenland_struggle|E] is currently in. It can also be influenced by various [decisions|E], most importantly by [greenland_supporting|E] [greenland|E]. The maximum amount Resilience can reach is #Bold 1000#!.\n\nOnce Resilience goes below 100, then there is a small chance the [greenland_settlements|E] will naturally fail."

These can include political, economic, and cultural ties. It is one of the two global values tied to [greenland|E], alongside @RICE_greenland_resilience_icon! [greenland_resilience|E].\n\nFor those [struggle_involved|E] in the [RICE_greenland_struggle|E], higher Networks have positive effects on a number of mechanics and [decisions|E]. In particular, the higher Networks is, the more [gold|E] and [prestige|E] you can get annually from a [greenland_estate_long|E]. Additionally, Networks and [greenland_resilience|E] must be at a high level in order to attain a good ending for the [RICE_greenland_struggle|E].\n\nNetworks naturally increases or decreases at a somewhat random rate every year depending on the [struggle_phase|E] the [RICE_greenland_struggle|E] is currently in. It can also be influenced by various [decisions|E], most importantly by [greenland_supporting|E] [greenland|E]. The maximum amount Networks can reach is #Bold 1000#!.\n\nIf Networks are low enough in the [struggle_phase_greenland_subsistence_simple|E] and [struggle_phase_greenland_marginalization_simple|E] [struggle_phase_phases|E], some [decisions|E] will be costlier, or even unavailable."

 game_concept_vinland_full_viability_desc: "Viability is a global value that represents how appealing settling in [vinland|E] is for those involved in the [RICE_greenland_struggle|E]. Despite its fame in pop history, the Norse did not stay in [vinland|E] for the long-term because it was too distant and would have been a waste of resources better spent on more profitable [greenland|E]. Thus, it will be a challenge to raise [vinlands|E] @RICE_vinland_viability_icon! Viability.\n\nThe main way to raise [vinlands|E] Viability while the [RICE_greenland_struggle|E] is active is through two [decisions|E]: either by sending [greenland_expeditions|E] to [vinland|E], or, if your [dynasty|E] has a [vinland_outpost|E], by [greenland_supporting|E] [vinland|E].

After all, historically, the Norse presence in [vinland|E] was quite ephemeral.\n\nIf you are dead set on colonizing [vinland|E], it will have to be done in several stages. First, your [dynasty|E] needs to take the [decision|E] to $RICE_north_atlantic_build_outpost_vinland$, which will give your [dynasty|E] the [GetModifier('RICE_north_atlantic_vinland_outpost').GetNameWithTooltip] [modifier|E].

 north_atlantic.0090.info: "\n#emphasis Historical Context:#! There is clear genetic, historical, and literary evidence that modern-day Icelanders have a significant amount of Gaelic ancestry. Roughly more than 50% of the women and at least 20% of the men involved in the initial settlement of Iceland may have been of Gaelic origin, and while many were probably slaves or servants, it is not implausible that a sizeable minority of them came as free men and women. Given the Norse raided and enslaved many all over Europe, it is possible people from other regions of Europe were part of the initial settlement of Iceland as well.\n\nA famous case of potential Gaelic ancestry would be Leif Erikson, who may have been distantly descended from Irish nobility. Another famous case is that of Melkorka, a supposed Irish princess who was taken as a concubine by an Icelandic chieftain. Her son, Olaf the Peacock, purportedly traveled to Ireland and was offered the throne by his grandfather, before going on various adventures.\n\nMany of these Gaelic men and women were assimilated (probably forcibly, in many cases) into Norse society, and it is likely that later Icelanders hid their Gaelic ancestry, if they had any, due to the shame of potentially being descended from lowly slaves. Still, they may have influenced Icelandic history and culture in more ways than one. For instance, they may have contributed to the early presence of Christianity in Iceland. Additionally, there is evidence that the Sagas, which are typically associated with the pagan Vikings despite being compiled by Christian Icelanders, may have borrowed ideas, motifs, and plotlines from Irish mythology and literature, even if none of the characters or deities are Gaelic per se."

 north_atlantic.0205.desc: "Geysers are a remarkable phenomenon in [GetGeographicalRegion('custom_iceland').GetName], and I had the opportunity to visit my territories there to observe one such geyser in person (from a safe distance, of course). It is not every day that someone gets to see such a remarkable sight!"
 north_atlantic.0205.a: "It was very interesting to see."
 north_atlantic.0206.t: "Iceland Moss"
 north_atlantic.0206.desc: "Iceland moss, as it is known, is a lichen with a conspicuous presence throughout the mountainous regions of the North Atlantic, but especially [GetGeographicalRegion('custom_iceland').GetName]. While edible, many people of higher status such as myself avoid eating it, as it is obviously food more suitable for peasants to eat.\n\nHowever, I’ve been told recently that this Iceland moss makes for good medicine, to assist with poor appetite, or soothing chest ailments or coughs. Perhaps I should acquire some for my use."
 north_atlantic.0206.a: "It’s still peasant food – my doctors have better remedies."
 north_atlantic.0206.b: "A good idea! There’s a lot of it, so it’ll be easy to find."
 north_atlantic.0207.t: "Puffin Meat"
 north_atlantic.0207.desc: "Puffins can be found throughout the Atlantic coast, and here, they’re often considered a local delicacy. I recently had the honor of serving puffin meat as the highlight of a small feast that I hosted for a number of visiting dignitaries. These dignitaries praised my cooks for how well they were able to prepare this meat, and we all had a great time."
 north_atlantic.0207.a: "My cooks did a good job!"
 north_atlantic.0208.t: "Dairy Inhospitality"
 north_atlantic.0208.desc: "Everybody enjoys eating dairy products like yogurt and cheese curds. However, in [GetGeographicalRegion('custom_iceland').GetName], it is considered rude to serve them to esteemed guests, especially if one has better food to offer.\n\n[milkdrinker.Custom('TitledFirstName')], unfortunately, has a bad habit of serving [milkdrinker.GetHerHis] guests such products. [milkdrinker.GetSheHe|U] thus has a reputation for showing poor hospitality to [milkdrinker.GetHerHis] guests.\n\nRecently, when I paid [milkdrinker.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] an informal visit, [milkdrinker.GetSheHe] only gave me some #italic skyr#!, Iceland’s style of yogurt! [milkdrinker.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] claimed since it was not meal time, there was no need to serve a large meal. #italic Skyr#! is a rather delicious blend of creamy, sour and sweet flavors, true, but this is still an insult to a self-respecting [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] like myself. I can't just ignore this!"
 north_atlantic.0208.a: "I like yogurt, though, so I’ll ignore the slight this time."
 north_atlantic.0208.b: "Scandalous! How dare [milkdrinker.GetSheHe]! I’ll insult [milkdrinker.GetHerHim] back!"
 north_atlantic.0208.c: "Perhaps I can convince [milkdrinker.GetHerHim] to change [milkdrinker.GetHerHis] ways."
 north_atlantic.0208.c.success: "[milkdrinker.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] agrees to be more hospitable in the future"
 north_atlantic.0208.c.failure: "[milkdrinker.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] refuses to change [milkdrinker.GetHerHis] ways"
 north_atlantic.0208.info: "\n#emphasis Historical Context:#! Dairy products have been consumed in Northern and Western Europe for centuries, and #italic skyr#! is the name of the Icelandic variant of yogurt. Interestingly, in the Icelandic sagas, serving items like milk, cheese, or yogurt to guests was considered improper, particularly if other food could be provided. Being immersed in milk products could be considered especially humiliating.\n\nIn one episode of the #italic Egil's Saga#!, for instance, the protagonist Egil and his companions visit a man named Armod, who only serves them #italic skyr#!. Egil takes this as a great insult, and, in revenge, vomits the yogurt all over Armod, who in turn vomits back at Egil. When Armod's men ask why Egil did such a thing, he says, "Don’t blame me for following the master of the house’s example. He’s spewing his guts out just as much as I am.""
