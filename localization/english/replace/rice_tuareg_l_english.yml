These lands witness frequent changes in political allegiances and confederations, as the desert tribes come together or split apart for a variety of reasons.\n\n[tuareg_founder.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] has initiated yet another major change in the political landscape of this region. [tuareg_founder.GetSheHe|U] has proclaimed that [tuareg_founder.GetSheHe] and others like [tuareg_founder.GetHerHim] to be [tuareg.GetName], descendants of Tin Hinan, a legendary $heritage_berber_name$ queen who lived back in the days of the ancient Romans. The [tuareg.GetCollectiveNoun] have, over the years, developed customs and values that set them apart from their brethren, such as their great respect for the women of their tribes, and their insistence that men have to wear veils, particularly the blue or indigo-dyed #italic tagelmust#!.\n\nAnyways, the rise of the [tuareg.GetNameNoTooltip] will undoubtedly alter the trajectory of the Sahara’s history."

 tuareg.0011.desc: "Many years ago, the [tuareg.GetCollectiveNoun] arrived in the region where the Sahara and the Sahel met, and established for themselves a new home in the open deserts and arid plains.\n\nNow, [tuareg_unifier.Custom('TitledFirstName')], one of the descendants of these original pioneers – whether by blood or in spirit – has united many of the tribes in the region into a new, powerful state: the [GetTitleByKey('e_air').GetName].\n\nAlready, [GetTitleByKey('e_air').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] controls a significant portion of the Trans-Saharan trade routes criss-crossing the Sahara. Rulers from across Africa will undoubtedly watch as [tuareg_unifier.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] and [tuareg_unifier.GetHerHis] realm continues to grow in influence and wealth.\n\nIn the end, many empires rise and fall in these desert sands, so only time will tell how long [GetTitleByKey('e_air').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] will remain powerful and relevant."

 tuareg.0012.desc: "I have decided to journey into the remote parts of the Aïr mountains deep in [GetGeographicalRegion('world_africa_sahara').GetName]. Why would anyone go to such a place, in such an arid land? For its hot springs, of course!\n\nThere are many hot springs in that region, some of which are famous for their healing properties.

 tuareg.0013.desc: "Though the journey was tough, I have arrived at my destination: Tafadek Spring, one of the more notable hot springs in the Aïr mountains.\n\nSoaking myself in these waters makes me feel so relaxed and reinvigorated. Perhaps it is true, as they say, that these waters hold great medicinal value!"

Unlike many of the nearby cultures, they have a tradition of veiling their men and not their women. Adult men will even feel ashamed of showing their mouth or nose to strangers or those who are of higher status. Historically, this practice is attested among certain Berber/Amazigh tribes, including those connected to the Tuareg. For instance, the Almoravids, who domianted much of North Africa and Iberia in the 11th century, were derided by their enemies like the Almohads for this practice."
