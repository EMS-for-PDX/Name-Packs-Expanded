 guanche.0030.desc:0 "The Beñesmen Festival will start soon, and everyone is doing their best to prepare for this occasion. As the traditional [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] new year and harvest festival, it is of extreme importance to our community. I've worked with other notables to make sure that this year's celebration will be a success, and that [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm], especially [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.CreatorName], [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.WealthGodName], and [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HealthGodName], will be pleased by our efforts."
 guanche.0030.a:0 "I can't wait for it to start!"
 guanche.0031.t:0 "Beñesmen Begins!"
 guanche.0031.desc:0 "The Beñesmen Festival is upon us! Many locals, ranging from the most powerful [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord] like myself to the various [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] to the humblest shepherds and peasants, have gathered before a nearby #italic tagoror#!, a circle of stones whose purpose is to hold meetings like these and located on one of the highest points in the area.\n\nPraise to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm] that we have been able to harvest as much as we could this year! Their aid to us is truly a boon for us in this often chaotic and troubled world beset by the forces of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName]."
 guanche.0031.a:0 "Praise [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm]! Let the festivities begin!"
 guanche.0032.t:0 "Beñesmen Ends"
 guanche.0032.desc:0 "The Beñesmen Festival has come to a close. Everyone had a good time, and it was a great way to mark the end of the harvesting season and the old year. We can only hope that [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm] will favor our realm with this coming new year, and bless these lands with an abundance of crops and prosperity."

 guanche.0034.desc:0 "Part of the Beñesmen Festival involves ritually assigning tasks that each member of the community will be involved in the coming year, such as herding, fishing, or making crafts. I sit at the #italic tagoror#! - a stone circle serving as a community meeting place - and together with other notables, go through the motions of this important ceremony."
 guanche.0034.a:0 "You do this, you do that, you do this, you do that…."
 guanche.0035.t:0 "Praise Be To [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.FertilityGodName]"
 guanche.0035.desc:0 "As part of the festivities I pay homage to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.FertilityGodName], so that the land may be full of abundance and that our descendants will multiply as well. I approach a sacred stone or boulder to say my prayers."
 guanche.0035.a:0 "O, [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.FertilityGodName], hear my prayer!"
 guanche.0035.toast:0 "A [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] says [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.FertilityGodName] heard my prayer!"
 guanche.0036.t:0 "Glory of the Mountains"
 guanche.0036.desc:0 "In [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] beliefs, mountains and tall geographical features hold a position as sacred places. As the Beñesmen festivities continue, every now and then I look to the nearby hills and mountains, and watch in awe at what [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm] have created for us."
 guanche.0036.a:0 "Truly inspiring."
 guanche.0037.t:0 "Offerings of Sheep and Goats"
 guanche.0037.desc:0 "As part of the offerings to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm] during Beñesmen, we give them the skulls and hoofs of sheep and goats, tossing them into the fire. The smoke rises into the sky as we pray, and a [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] tells me the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm] will surely be pleased."
 guanche.0037.a:0 "I can only hope so."
 guanche.0038.t:0 "Rock On"
 guanche.0038.desc:0 "During Beñesmen, some of us strike lithophones - stones and rocks that give off melodious songs - to accompany our singing and prayers. It is a beautiful thing, these sounds of nature makes me feel at ease and better attuned to the glory of  [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm]."
 guanche.0038.a:0 "What lovely music!"
 guanche.0039.t:0 "Feasting"
 guanche.0039.desc:0 "We just concluded the sacrifice of sheep and goats to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm] for Beñesmen, and now we are feasting on their meat. Roasted over the fire, the meat goes well with other foodstuffs like seeds and grains."
 guanche.0039.a:0 "Delicious!"
 guanche.0040.t:0 "Juniper"
 guanche.0040.desc:0 "I and several others throw juniper onto the fire as we continue making our sacrifices and saying our prayers for Beñesmen. The fragrant smell spreads throughout the area, and inspires us to greater deeds of holiness and virtue."
 guanche.0040.a:0 "What a wonderful plant."
 guanche.0041.t:0 "Dances"
 guanche.0041.desc:0 "Beñesmen isn’t just a time for somber prayer - it is also a celebration for the end of the harvest! Part of that celebration involves dancing, and right now, a number of us have started to engage in such dancing. Men and women approach one another and, without touching, twist and revolve around each other to the sound of the music and the stomping, clapping, and whistling of spectators."
 guanche.0041.a:0 "This is fun!"
 guanche.0042.t:0 "What Music to Sing and Dance to?"
 guanche.0042.desc:0 "Beñesmen is a festival full of various kinds of music, and it’s time to choose what to sing and dance to next. Everyone looks to me, the highest ranked notable present, to choose. Perhaps we can join our hands and sing, if not weep, of melancholy songs that speak of bittersweet events of yore. Or maybe we can sing some warlike chants to celebrate the heroes of the past. "
 guanche.0042.a:0 "Let us sing the melancholy songs, and feel the deep sentiment in our hearts!"
 guanche.0042.b:0 "This is a time to celebrate with the songs of triumphant, victorious heroes! "
 guanche.0043.t:0 "Sport"
 guanche.0043.desc:0 "As the Beñesmen continues, it is now time for sport and competition! Many of us gather around in a circle as we watch talented men and women compete in wrestling, running, and the shepherd’s leap - traveling across dangerous terrain by using only a long wooden stick to bounce and hop to and fro in an agile manner."
 guanche.0043.a:0 "A thrilling spectacle!"
 guanche.0044.t:0 "Settling Disputes"
 guanche.0044.desc:0 "Beñesmen is often an opportunity for disputes to be resolved between people in the community. I, along with other important elders and [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')], have just now successfully ended a feud between two families in the community, who have agreed to bury the hatchet in the spirit of the festivities."

 guanche.0050.desc:0 "It is remarkable that no one has yet established a sugarcane industry here on [madeira_county.GetNameNoTier] despite the island’s excellent geography and abundant timber. Now, using my various connections, I have found a number of merchants operating in the Mediterranean who are willing to fund the introduction of sugarcane to the island. With enough slave labor as well as investment from merchants, this is the start of something wonderful on Madeira\n\nThere are some who believe with proper management, we can even eclipse the traditional sugarcane production centers like Sicily, Cyprus, and Andalusian within a generation or two. I say that’s an unrealistic prediction, but I admire such optimism; that would be too good to be true, and if such a thing could happen, there surely would be some kind of catch."
 guanche.0050.a:0 "Nonetheless, we’ll likely make plenty of profit."
 guanche.0051.t:0 "Introducing Sugarcane to Madeira"
 guanche.0051.desc:0 "[madeira_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] has taken the initiative to introduce sugarcane to [madeira_county.GetNameNoTier]; the island’s abundant timber will undoubtedly fuel the burgeoning sugar industry here. Working together with merchants from the Mediterranean who wish to bypass their business rivals elsewhere, [madeira_ruler.GetFirstName] is not only bringing in sugar itself, but also slaves to work the fields and advisors from places as far as Sicily and beyond to oversee the construction of sugarmills and more. There are some who think the island might even surpass the traditional sugarcane production centers like Sicily, Cyprus, and Andalusia one day."
 guanche.0051.a:0 "Endless sugar…. It sounds too good to be true!"
 guanche.0052.t:0 "Madeira's Sugar Industry Collapses"
 guanche.0052.desc:0 "We should have acted, but it’s too late now. The rapidly diminishing supplies of timber on [madeira_county.GetNameNoTier] were the warning signs we ignored. It’s hard to imagine how Madeira, the island of endless timber, would one day no longer have enough timber to sustain its sugar industry, but that day has come.\n\nMerchants who own and operate Madeira’s once sprawling sugarcane farms and industrious sugar mills have told me that sugar production is at an all-time low due to the sudden lack of locally available timber, and the island’s sugar industry is quickly collapsing. While the sugar industry here may recover one day, it will have to rely on exported timber and will never reach its once glorious heights."
 guanche.0052.a:0 "This is not good for our economy."
 guanche.0053.t:0 "Madeira's Sugar Industry Collapses"
 guanche.0053.desc:0 "For decades, the amount of sugar produced on [madeira_county.GetNameNoTier] was the envy of the known world. Much of this was due in part to the vast amounts of timber found on the island that fueled this sugar industry. The once great sugar production centers like Cyprus, Andalusia, and Sicily paled in comparison to the profits coming into Madeira. Alas, all good things have to come to an end.\n\nYears of unabated, unsustainable timber harvesting have caused massive deforestation on Madeira, and many of the sugarcane farms and sugar mills on the island are closing shop - there simply isn’t enough local timber around to use anymore. While the sugar industry here may recover one day, it will never reach its once glorious heights."
 guanche.0053.a:0 "Where will the center of sugar production now shift?"

 guanche.0055.desc:0 "Ever since sugarcane was first introduced to [madeira_county.GetNameNoTier], enterprising merchants from the Mediterranean and Western Europe have also considered investing in bringing sugar to the Canary Islands. Recently, their plans have come to fruition.\n\nWorking together with local elites, these merchants are starting to establish local sugarcane plantations in [canarias_county.GetNameNoTier] and [fuerteventura_county.GetNameNoTier]. They have brought in specialists from Madeira and elsewhere to oversee the process, and slaves from much of Africa to toil away in squalid conditions to produce sugar.\n\nThe sugar mills in the Canary Islands are not expected to produce as much as in Madeira, but it should still be fairly profitable."
 guanche.0055.a:0 "The islands’ economy will certainly benefit from this."

These demons of [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] folklore are said to look like black dogs with long hair and red eyes, and prey on livestock and even people. At any rate, recently a number of livestock have been mysteriously killed, and many locals believe these terrible demons are the cause."
 guanche.0060.a:0 "Pray to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm] to deliver us from these evils!"

Traditionally, these people - skilled in the [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] whistling language - to communicate information across the mountains and valleys of our homelands. This method is used to disseminate important public announcements.\n\nMy new whistlers, at any rate, are quite talented and able to produce louder whistling than my previous ones, which should help me with managing my local affairs."

 guanche.0063.t:0 "Shepherd's Leap"
 guanche.0063.desc:0 "Today I am spectating a competition of leaping by local [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] shepherds. The Canary Islands, where the Guanche originate from, are rugged in many parts, so shepherds there have traditionally used long wooden poles to vault themselves across ravines or down steep terrain. Over the centuries, a number of acrobatic techniques have been developed for practitioners to swiftly move across these spaces, seemingly with little effort, and the so-called #italic Shepherd's Leap#! has become something of a local sport."
 guanche.0063.a:0 "A spectacular sight to behold!"

 guanche.0067.desc:0 "On my way to take care of business in my realm, I pass by a lithophone used in some of the local [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] ceremonies. These rocks produce musical sounds that are pleasing to the ear, and, more importantly, pleasing to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm], hence their usage in ceremonies. One of the guards in my entourage, familiar with the area, tells me that even witches and foul spirits are fearful of this stone, and local legend has it that striking it can deter these dangerous beings from getting too near oneself to cause harm."
 guanche.0067.a:0 "I have heard about such marvelous tales."
