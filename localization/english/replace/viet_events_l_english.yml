One of these merchants, a well-traveled gastronome who enjoys discovering the foods of different lands, gave me some baklava as a gift. It is a pastry from the eastern Mediterranean that is made from thin layers of dough, filled with syrup, honey, and nuts. Truly, it is one of the most delicious foods ever imagined."

I stumbled over my words as I struggled to recall any details of my dream as my servant stood there awkwardly.\n\nWhy is it often too easy to forget what happens in the world of dreams?"
 VIETmisc.0005.a: "How irritating. Oh well!"
 VIETmisc.0005.b: "I must remember! Why can't I? Why?"
 VIETmisc.0005.a.a: "You remember what the dream was about"

 VIETmisc.0013.desc: "I was walking outside in the garden with the rest of my court when my foot slipped and I nearly tumbled. Thankfully I caught my step before it was too late, but it was still embarrassing it happened in front of the whole court, as I must have looked like a fool!"

 VIETmisc.0013.b: "Try to pretend it didn't happen."
 VIETmisc.0013.c: "Make a self-deprecating joke."
 VIETmisc.0014.t: "An Embarrassing Memory"
 VIETmisc.0014.desc: "I suddenly remembered an embarrassing memory from the past. When I think of what I did, my heart tightens and I can't help but shudder at my foolish actions or thoughts. Why did I even do that back then, and more importantly, why does my brain remind me about these things?"

 VIETmisc.0017.t: "An Early Bird"
 VIETmisc.0017.desc: "By chance I woke up earlier than I usually do today and can't go back to sleep. I have some important documents to review that I could get a head start on, but on the other hand, why should I have to worry about that?"

 VIETmisc.0018.t: "Too Late!"
 VIETmisc.0018.desc: "A few days ago, I was having a conversation with someone. It wasn't an intense quarrel by any means, but the discussion was a little heated at some points. The other person made a good argument that I didn't have any comeback to, even though I knew they were wrong.\n\nJust today, while I was going about my business, I finally thought of a proper counterargument I could have used in that conversation. My mind sure works in mysterious ways - why didn't I think of it sooner? If I had thought of it, I would have surely won our little debate... right? "
 VIETmisc.0018.a: "This is so frustrating!"
 VIETmisc.0019.t: "An Old Shrine"
 VIETmisc.0019.desc: "I paid a visit to some small ruins not too far away. Locals say many generations ago it served as a tiny [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship] in the area, a place for those who truly believed in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName|U] to worship, though others are skeptical. Regardless, I prayed there for a while."
 VIETmisc.0019.a: "It was a good experience."
 VIETmisc.0019.b: "I only did it out of courtesy and obligation."
 VIETmisc.0020.t: "Ha Ha!"
 VIETmisc.0020.desc: "I heard a great joke earlier today that made me laugh without stopping for a couple minutes, but now I can't recall it at all. This is really bothering me."

 VIETmisc.0021.t: "Who's there?"
 VIETmisc.0021.desc: ""[ROOT.Char.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]!" a voice calls from behind. "[ROOT.Char.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]!"\n\n"Who is it?" I say loudly.\n\nSilence.\n\nHmm. Odd.\n\nI thought I heard someone calling my name. Yet, when I turned my head around, there was no one around.\n\nVery odd...."
 VIETmisc.0021.a: "Must have been my imagination."
 VIETmisc.0022.t: "A Boring Meeting"
 VIETmisc.0022.desc: "It was an ordinary, mundane meeting with my council. We were discussing a rather boring topic that wasn't of the utmost urgency. I looked around, seeing my councilors as they droned on and on about this or that, and wondered whether any of this was worth my attention."
 VIETmisc.0022.a: "Look outside the window and see what's out there."
 VIETmisc.0022.b: "Pretend to look like I am paying attention."

 VIETmisc.0023.t: "Got to Go, Got to Go Right Now!"
 VIETmisc.0023.desc: "A very important envoy from a foreign state is paying me a visit. I sit on my throne, listening to this talkative gentleman drone on, and on, and on, and on. It seems to go on forever, and I am even starting to doze off out of boredom, when I realize something alarming. Dangerous, even.\n\nI really need to go to the chamber pot.\n\nBadly.\n\nRight now.\n\nI can't hold it in, I am about to burst any moment now - what do I do?"
 VIETmisc.0023.a: "I must run to the chamber pot immediately!"
 VIETmisc.0023.b: "I must... hold it in... NO!"

 VIETmisc.0023.toast.b.failure.title: "You couldn't hold your bladder in!"
 VIETmisc.0023.toast.b.failure: "You have an accident in front of the envoy. Embarrassing, yet preventable - why didn't you listen to your body's natural instincts to run to the chamber pot?"
 VIETmisc.0024.t: "Unfortunate Flower"
 VIETmisc.0024.desc: "While taking a walk outside I found a very beautiful flower. However, as I went over to take a closer look at it, potentially to pick it up and keep it, I misstepped and accidentally stomped on it."
 VIETmisc.0024.a: "Oh well, it can't be helped!"
 VIETmisc.0024.b: "No! I wanted that flower! Dammit!"
 VIETmisc.0025.t: "Cool Breeze"

 VIETmisc.0026.desc: "I came to my desk this morning to wrap up some important paperwork. I searched for the last document I needed to finish, yet I couldn't find it! In a panic, I searched the whole room for what must have been a couple hours. Finally, I found it when I realized I put it in one of my books as a bookmark. My little crisis is averted, but that definitely made me tense and anxious for a while."
 VIETmisc.0026.a.a: "You successfully relax"
 VIETmisc.0026.toast.a: "You successfully relaxed"
 VIETmisc.0026.a.b: "You fail to relax"
 VIETmisc.0026.toast.b: "You failed to relax"
 VIETmisc.0026.a: "I need to take a deep breath and relax."
 VIETmisc.0027.t: "Executing the Psychopath"
 VIETmisc.0027.desc: "A murderer was recently caught. His crimes were quite heinous, not to mention he showed no remorse, and said he felt delight at inflicting pain on others. There was little debate on what needed to be done. He was duly sentenced to die a horrible slow execution, and today my court and I got to witness this gory spectacle. Everyone is talking about how such a monster could even exist! What are my thoughts on the matter?"
 VIETmisc.0027.a: "Yes, I agree It is tragic that such people exist in this world!"
 VIETmisc.0027.b: "I don't care, to be honest, but I have to keep appearances."
 VIETmisc.0027.c: "Pity, my army could use another bloodthirsty psychopath."
 VIETmisc.0028.t: "Age of Empires"
 VIETmisc.0028.desc: "In antiquity, the Romans were one of the greatest empires the world had ever seen. Still, there were other powerful states as well from that ancient time. I am reading stories about the deeds and exploits of other great empires from then, and one in particular inspires me."

Did someone drop it here by accident? Who knows.\n\nThere doesn't look to be anyone around, so it looks like this coin belongs to me now."
 VIETmisc.0029.a: "It is very shiny indeed." 
 VIETmisc.0030.t: "Careful, Now"
 VIETmisc.0030.desc: ""It's been an honor to meet. Thank you for your hospitality, [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')] [ROOT.Char.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')].... Until we meet again." The foreign envoy bows to me in respect, and is about to leave.\n\nI stand up to say farewell, but stumble out of my chair and clumsily fall on the ground.\n\nThankfully I did not hurt myself, but that was still embarrassing!"
 VIETmisc.0030.a: "At least the envoy was polite about it."
 VIETmisc.0031.t: "Good Dream"
 VIETmisc.0031.desc: "I had a dream where I came into a realm of light, and nothing but light. Light was everywhere, and all I could see. Yet this did not frighten me - if anything, I felt at peace with the cosmos.\n\nAfter I woke up, the feeling of serenity stayed with me for the rest of the day."
 VIETmisc.0031.a: "Surely this is a sign from [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]!"

 VIETmisc.0032.t: "Bad Dream"
 VIETmisc.0032.desc: "I had a dream where I was in a realm of darkness, and nothing but darkness.

 VIETmisc.0033.t: "Challenging Reading"
 VIETmisc.0033.desc: "The book I'm reading is very difficult, and its deeper meanings continue to elude me. Learned men say even the wisest among them still have trouble at times reading this book.

My head... itchy!\n\nI scratch my head slightly but discretely, thinking that would've taken care of it, but I was mistaken! My head is even itchier now, and I want to scratch it so badly even if I'll look like a crazed monkey in front of these people. Aagh!"

 VIETmisc.0037.t: "A Nosy Problem"
 VIETmisc.0037.desc: "While relaxing in my courtyard, I notice one of my young maidservants trying to discreetly pick her nose. To be fair to her, she is very discrete about it, and no one else noticed. On the other hand, it is a rather rude thing to do, and as she's still somewhat young, perhaps she needs to learn proper manners."
 VIETmisc.0037.a: "I'm sure she didn't mean to, something must have clogged up her nose."
 VIETmisc.0037.b: "I'll approach her in secret later to gently reprimand her about this."
 VIETmisc.0037.c: "Ha! I'll mock her in front of everyone to teach her a lesson."
 VIETmisc.0037.d: "How dare she! Give her some lashings. That ought to do it."
 VIETmisc.0038.t: "The Purpose of Storytelling"
 VIETmisc.0038.desc: "I overhear two of my servants arguing about a play they recently attended. I happen to have seen this play too, and listen carefully to hear their discussion.\n\n"You actually like it? The story's terrible and silly!" the portly maid says. "It only appeals to those without taste."\n\n"You are wrong there," the tall, thin manservant counters. "It"s precisely meant to be mindless entertainment. Sometimes, we need stories that are light-hearted - who wants to deal with serious, sad tales all the time?"\n\nPerhaps I should intervene in their debate?"
 VIETmisc.0038.a: "No, I've no interest in this topic."
 VIETmisc.0038.b: "I agree with the maid - that play was complete garbage."
 VIETmisc.0038.c: "The manservant is right. It wasn't quality, but it made me laugh."

 VIETmisc.0039.a: "I think so too. The couple look blissfully happy."
 VIETmisc.0039.b: "Come on. Every marriage eventually devolves into arguments and cheating."
 VIETmisc.0039.c: "I don't care about it as much as all the delicious food here!"
 VIETmisc.0039.d: "Too many people here - I think I"ll just go sit in the corner."

 VIETmisc.0040.t: "It Will Be Alright... Right?"
 VIETmisc.0040.desc: ""It's going to be alright, things will always get better," my nanny used to tell me when I was a child and feeling scared or frustrated.\n\nI've been thinking about those words a lot lately, especially when I'm dealing with a lot of things on my mind. But now, my nanny is no longer here to comfort me.\n\nI have to wonder whether things will be alright in the end."

 VIETmisc.0041.desc: "While we were taking a walk in the garden outside, [scope_VIET_slip_bumper.Custom('TitledFirstName')] slipped and bumped into me! No one was hurt, nor did anyone fall down, but it was a rather embarrassing affair and [scope_VIET_slip_bumper.GetSheHe] looks quite sheepish for [scope_VIET_slip_bumper.GetHerHis] accidental disrespect towards me."

 VIETmisc.0042.t: "A Problem"
 VIETmisc.0042.desc: "Today, I am meeting with a visitor from one of the powerful local clans who have great influence over a small but important part of my realm. I met this person the other day, when we got to know each other formally.

As I am about to say my greetings, however, something unimaginably terrible happens!"
 VIETmisc.0042.a: "Oh no! What do I do now?"
 VIETmisc.0043.tooltip: "You get into a very dangerous situation...."
 VIETmisc.0043.t: "What's The Name?"
 VIETmisc.0043.desc: "Tragedy! I have forgotten my guest's name!\n\nWhat was their name? Was it this? Or was it that? No, it couldn't have been... or maybe it was....\n\nI force a smile to buy myself time as my brain scrambles to remember their name.\n\nWhat do I do? I only have a few more moments to say something before this gets too awkward."
 VIETmisc.0043.a: "I'll just have to guess their name!"
 VIETmisc.0043.b: "I'll skillfully speak in a way that avoids their name, awkward as it may be."

 VIETmisc.0044.desc.1: "Lately, rumors are circulating about how I had an amorous encounter with one of the peasants in a nearby village that resulted in a child. This is, of course, completely foolish."
 VIETmisc.0044.desc.lustful: "Now I love to have a good tumble with a good looking peasant as much as any lusty [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan], but that doesn't mean I've found anyone in that village to my liking."
 VIETmisc.0044.desc.chaste: "I don't even feel that much lust for that kind of fornication! It makes no sense that I would endanger myself for that which I don't want."
 VIETmisc.0044.desc.normal: "The fact is, I barely even go to this village and don't know anyone there. There's no reason why this rumor should exist."
 VIETmisc.0044.desc.2: "Anyways, this is an absolute stain on my honor."
 VIETmisc.0044.a: "There isn't much I can do - these are just vile rumors."

 VIETmisc.0046.desc: "I finished reading a really good book.

 VIETmisc.0046.b: "Let it inspire me in my work"
 VIETmisc.0046.c: "Write down my thoughts"
 VIETmisc.0047.t: "Quality Reading"
 VIETmisc.0047.desc: "It's been a while since I found a really good book to read. A friend recommended this one to me, and said it has the kind of characters and stories I'd like. Now, I want nothing better than to curl up on my bed and read it. But should I waste my time getting lost in a good book, or should I moderate myself so I'll still have time for my other duties?"
 VIETmisc.0047.a: "I don’t worry about the rest of the world when I have stories like these!"
 VIETmisc.0047.b: "It'd be bad if I lost myself in my hobbies, as I have work to do."
 VIETmisc.0048.t: "Melodramatic"
 VIETmisc.0048.desc: "I am watching a play being performed by a troupe of traveling actors. The quality of their acting is… bad, and that's an understatement. The main problem is that they are overly melodramatic when they act, so none of their characters or storylines seem believable.\n\nWhen the play is finished, the response from the audience is anemic at best. It seems most people don’t like their acting either, and I'm surprised no one was booing them off stage - the acting troupe is definitely lucky in that regard! How do they even survive?"
 VIETmisc.0048.a: "What a waste of an afternoon!"
 VIETmisc.0048.b: "I'll give them some money out of pity."
 VIETmisc.0048.c: "Their acting is so bad, they deserve some lashings."

 VIETmisc.0049.desc: "A [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship] in my realm suffered a tragedy recently when unknown assailants broke in at night and vandalized some of the religious art and sculptures inside. It seems these hooligans wanted to cause trouble, as they weren't thieves looking to steal priceless spiritual artifacts. Either way, they managed to escape before the guards could catch them, and we have no idea who they are.\n\nRegardless, while the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship] didn’t suffer extensive damage, it is seeking any help in rebuilding."
 VIETmisc.0049.a: "Unfortunately for them, I don’t have the funds to spare for their problem."
 VIETmisc.0049.b: "How sad! I will provide some donations to help them with their rebuilding."
 VIETmisc.0049.c: "I can provide funds to aid them, but only if they promise to speak well of me."
 VIETmisc.0050.t: "Strange Art"
 VIETmisc.0050.desc: "A famous painter lives not too far from where I live. I paid him a visit to see what his latest works of art were.\n\nTo my surprise, it seems like he is experimenting with some rather unusual ideas - depictions of strange if not horrifying otherworldly creatures, unorthodox mixtures of colors and shapes, concepts not seen elsewhere, and more. Yet I can't deny these odd experiments in art have their charm."
 VIETmisc.0050.a: "Charming as they are, this art is too strange for my tastes."
 VIETmisc.0050.b: "I'm sure someone appreciates this kind of art somewhere."
 VIETmisc.0050.c: "I love his splendid ideas! So bold and brash!"
 VIETmisc.0050.d: "An affront to our sensibilities! He must paint more acceptable things."
 VIETmisc.0050.e: "Surely this is worship of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] in a different but legitimate way!"
 VIETmisc.0051.t: "Old Ruins"
 VIETmisc.0051.desc: "While on the road to take care of some business, we stopped at an ancient ruin to rest. The ruin is relatively small in size and doesn't cover a large area, and not much remains.\n\nI stroll around it for a bit and examine its walls, which appear to have some kinds of artwork or carvings. Most of it is too weathered away for me to figure out what it depicts, but it does remind me that this place must have used to look gorgeous back in the day."
 VIETmisc.0051.a: "Whatever the case, I should rest a bit before I continue my journey."
 VIETmisc.0052.t: "Almost Too Real"
 VIETmisc.0052.desc: "While visiting a local nobleman, he shows us one of his prized possessions: a painting he acquired sometime ago that depicts a beautiful woman. Now, paintings about people are nothing out of the ordinary, but this painting in particular is famous because the artist managed to do an extremely realistic depiction of a person - so real, that it almost feels as if that the painting looks as if it is a real, living, breathing lady, who at any moment will jump out the frame and interact with us."
 VIETmisc.0052.a: "A most impressive work of art!"
 VIETmisc.0052.b: "Oh, I’m thinking of what I could be doing with such a beauty…."
 VIETmisc.0053.t: "Brother and Sister"
 VIETmisc.0053.desc: "A play is being performed for me and my court.\n\nThis one has an interesting and dramatic story, as it involves relations between a brother and a sister who do not know they are related and fall in love. It is only after they consummate their love, marry, and have children that they tragically learn the truth. Their community ostracizes them, and unable to come to terms with their actions they commit suicide at the end of the story.\n\nTruly a sad tale, full of twists and turns! Everyone agrees it was a riveting performance."
 VIETmisc.0053.a: "Ah! What irony! What drama! What pathos! What tragedy!"
 VIETmisc.0053.b: "Disgusting - we are not here to watch this kind of perversion!"
 VIETmisc.0053.c: "To be honest I found it boring. Drama plays can be too much sometimes."
 VIETmisc.0053.d: "It’s sad other peoples scorn divine marriages unlike the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] faith."
 VIETmisc.0054.t: "Temple Art"
 VIETmisc.0054.desc: "I am spending time at a local [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship], one which I haven’t been to in a while. As I enter, I stand in awe at the interior's beauty. While it is not the largest house of worship, whoever built and decorated it was very clever with the limited resources they had. The artwork is sublime, the walls a pleasant glowing color, and sunlight filters through the windows from outside in such a way that it literally looks like there is a stairway to the heavens!"
 VIETmisc.0054.a: "This shows the indomitable strength of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] way."
 VIETmisc.0054.b: "I wish my house had an impressive room like this somewhere."

 VIETmisc.0055.desc: "The nervous young poet stands before me, reciting his latest poetry. Despite his nervousness, he performs splendidly for the most part, and everyone is impressed with the eloquence of his words and the way he expresses emotion.\n\nAlas, right in the middle of reciting his poetry, the poor man forgets the lines of his poem! His mouth opens slightly, his eyes pop out as he goes into a panic. He stutters the previous lines, in an attempt to remember. Meanwhile, everyone is watching awkwardly."
 VIETmisc.0055.a: "Sit there and don’t do anything."
 VIETmisc.0055.b: "Openly laugh at him and mock him."
 VIETmisc.0055.c: "Encourage him with inspiring words."

 VIETmisc.0056.desc: "I'm at a local tavern, enjoying some good food and some good music. The music, in particular, is being played by a veteran bard, who plays the lute as beautifully as he sings.\n\nIn the middle of his performance, however, tragedy strikes! The strings on his lute snap, and he is bereft of an instrument to play! He looks heartbroken as he stares in shock at the remains of his lute."
 VIETmisc.0056.a: "Well, I suppose there’s not much any of us can do about it."
 VIETmisc.0056.b: "Ha! How pathetic! How this is real entertainment!"
 VIETmisc.0056.c: "It’s alright, i'll buy him a drink and give him money for a new lute."
 VIETmisc.0057.t: "Repent!"
 VIETmisc.0057.desc: "Today while in town, I see a crowd gathered around a traveling [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] delivering a fiery sermon. He rants about people's sins, and how many of us will go to hell if we don't repent and listen to the true and noble [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] teachings. Most people aren't listening to his noisy ramblings too closely, and appear to be more amused by his antics more than anything."
 VIETmisc.0057.a: "The [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] is right. Do they wish to go to hell? Repent! Repent now!"
 VIETmisc.0057.b: "As long as we do the right thing and trust in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName|U] we will be fine."

 VIETmisc.0058.desc: "Last night I had a terrifying dream. Demons in service to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName] came and took me into some sort of room, where all sorts of gory and horrifying spectacles could be seen. They tied me up to some burning metal rod, and were about to start torturing me until I woke up, screaming.\n\nA terrifying experience, all in all, but thank goodness it was just a dream… right?"
 VIETmisc.0058.a: "I'm sure it was just a coincidence."
 VIETmisc.0058.b: "This is a lesson for me to be a more faithful [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] follower."
 VIETmisc.0059.t: "Gate of Hell"
 VIETmisc.0059.desc: "In the village I am visiting, I hear one of the elders tell me of a strange event that happened when she was a little girl.\n\nBack then, a giant hole appeared out of nowhere, causing a lot damage. The villagers were convinced it was the gateway to hell. They tried many different ways of dealing with it, such as tossing entire cows down the hole, and then a lot of dirt. Eventually something must have worked as the hole closed up.\n\nTo this day, no one is certain for sure what caused it, and all that remains is a small hollow in the land."
 VIETmisc.0059.a: "All's well that ends well, I suppose?"
 VIETmisc.0060.t: "A Changed Woman"
 VIETmisc.0060.desc: "Today I met an old village elder in my realm. As a young woman, she wickedly partook in all manner of sin, so she claims (the other elderly villagers told me later she was more a troublemaker than a genuine evildoer).\n\nHowever, one year, she fell ill with fever, and hovered between life and death for a year, so she claims (the other elderly villagers told me it was actually a month). During this time, she dreamt of visiting hell, and saw many terrifying visions.\n\nAfter she recovered, she realized she was given a second chance, and reformed to live a good, virtuous life, so she claims (the other elderly villagers say that part is true)."
 VIETmisc.0060.a: "Whether it’s true or not, her story is a very interesting one."
 VIETmisc.0060.b: "The elder’s story is inspiring! Faith in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName|U] saves us."
 VIETmisc.0060.c: "Really? Does she expect us to believe such exaggerated nonsense?"
 VIETmisc.0061.t: "A Warning"
 VIETmisc.0061.desc: "We all know that [scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.Custom('TitledFirstName')] isn't the most virtuous follower of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] way. None of us expected for [scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.Custom('TitledFirstName')] to be haunted by a ghost as punishment for the sins [scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.GetSheHe] committed in the past, however.\n\nGranted, we do not know why this apparition appears at night in [scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.GetHerHis] bedchambers, but according to [scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.Custom('TitledFirstName')] it resembles [scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.GetHerHis] old friend who was a great sinner and recently died. Now, [scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.GetSheHe] is convinced [scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.GetHerHis] friend is visiting [scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.GetHerHim] from hell to warn [scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.GetHerHim] about the consequences of [scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.GetHerHis] vices.\n\nThen again, none of [scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.GetHerHis] servants could verify reports of this ghost."
 VIETmisc.0061.a: "We can ask a [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] to say prayers for the deceased."
 VIETmisc.0061.b: "[scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.Custom('TitledFirstName')] might as well reform [scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.GetHerselfHimself] and be less sinful."
 VIETmisc.0061.c: "This is interesting and all but it's really not my problem, is it?"
 VIETmisc.0061.d: "I'm certain [scope_VIET_haunted_sinner.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is either hallucinating or making this up."
 VIETmisc.0062.t: "Hot or Cold?"
 VIETmisc.0062.desc: "As I engage in idle chat with [scope_VIET_hell_wonderer.Custom('TitledFirstName')] today, [scope_VIET_hell_wonderer.GetSheHe] asks me, "Have you read about how the  [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] scriptures describe hell? Some say that parts of hell are very hot and fiery, where you're in great pain from the heat and constantly burning. Other parts meanwhile are freezing cold, and your limbs grow numb with pain as you freeze to death again and again. I have to wonder whether a hot hell or a cold hell is preferable.""
 VIETmisc.0062.a: "The hot hell, as I can stand heat but not freezing temperatures."
 VIETmisc.0062.b: "The cold hell sounds less painful - relatively speaking."
 VIETmisc.0062.c: "It is improper to talk about these things."
 VIETmisc.0062.d: "Let's focus on living virtuously so we'll never see those places."

 VIETmisc.0063.desc: "An old adventurer I was acquainted with had recently passed away without any heirs, nor any family for that matter. Interestingly, he left all his belongings to me in his will - mainly a decent pile of gold and other precious items he had acquired as a result of his journeys to various places. Though we weren't really close friends, this surely means that he thought somewhat highly of me at the least, for some reason."
 VIETmisc.0063.a: "That was very kind of him."

 VIETmisc.0064.t: "Lost Child"

 VIETmisc.0065.desc: "I dreamt I was an adventurer in some pastoral, beautiful realm far, far away. I forgot whether I was a mighty warrior, a wise magician, or a cunning thief, but either way I helped many of the locals with their problems and felt a great sense of achievement. When I woke up, I smiled to myself as I fondly recall the many adventures I went on in that dream. In particular, I remember how I joined a certain organization and became a respected member of this society, which was specifically…"

 VIETmisc.0066.desc: "[scope_VIET_fellow_lost_traveler.Custom('TitledFirstName')] and I were separated from my entourage and guards while we were traveling to the next town. We found an abandoned ruin of an old building, where we took shelter. We decided to stay there for the night. After we got the fire started, and sat around it, things were a little awkward at first given the unusual circumstances, but we managed to start a rather pleasant conversation about various topics.\n\nThe next morning, my guards thankfully found us, and no one was hurt. Thanks to my shared experiences with [scope_VIET_fellow_lost_traveler.Custom('TitledFirstName')], we certainly think of each other more highly!"
 VIETmisc.0066.a: "It was good to have someone by my side in such a situation."
 VIETmisc.0067.t: "The Scholar and the Adventurer"
 VIETmisc.0067.desc: "Today, I met with the distinguished notables of a town in my realm. After the meeting, I engaged in some idle chat with two of them - one a well-read scholar of calm but stern disposition, the other an adventurer who had a constant sly expression on his face.\n\nThe latter told me about a strange, exotic foreign island across the southern seas he traveled to not long ago. “It is true,” he said, “that on this isle, they have birds the size of houses! I saw it with my own eyes.”\n\n“Our friend here is exaggerating,” the scholar says, “such things are unlikely.”\n\n“Are you really going to listen to this armchair bookworm? I’ve actually experienced these things.”"
 VIETmisc.0067.a: "I trust the wise scholar - travelers like to tell far-fetched tales for attention."
 VIETmisc.0067.b: "The adventurer’s right. Reading books is fine, but experience matters more."
 VIETmisc.0067.c: "Perhaps it is not my place to say who is right and who is wrong."
 VIETmisc.0068.t: "Exploring the Area"
 VIETmisc.0068.desc: "On occasion I like to take walks around my residence, but today I was feeling adventurous and decided to venture a little further than I usually do. With a few trusted guards, I made my way through the wilderness about a couple hour’s walk from my house, and spent time admiring the scenery. I even relaxed by a small stream and drank its fresh waters. All in all, the change in scenery had done me some good, for when I returned home later in the evening, I was in a very pleasant mood."
 VIETmisc.0068.a: "I should do this more often."
 VIETmisc.0069.t: "Best to Relax"
 VIETmisc.0069.desc: "On the road I saw a commoner sitting against a boulder. He noticed me, and stood up to greet me respectfully, before sitting back down to lay against the rock. Curious, I asked him what he was up to.\n\n“It’s a pleasant day, [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')], so I thought I’d just rest here for the time being.”\n\n“You don’t have any duties to worry about?”\n\n“Oh, I do, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], but I always like to take time to relax. Why work hard to stress yourself out, when you could do just what’s needed, and then enjoy yourself? It’s not every day a person gets a chance to relax!”"
 VIETmisc.0069.a: "Your words are wise and true! Enjoy your day of rest."
 VIETmisc.0069.b: "I’m not so sure… hard work is its own reward."

 VIETmisc.0070.t: "The Graveyard"
 VIETmisc.0070.desc: "While traveling, I come across a modestly sized graveyard serving a small town in my realm. Out of respect for the dead, or at least a sense of obligation, I pay my respects to the dead.

 VIETmisc.0073.desc: "I am spending some time in town when I pass by a young man chopping up some firewood. He seems a little slow, as he doesn’t seem to recognize I am a person of some importance when he examines me and looks at my guards.\n\n"Here for work?" he asks me casually, clearly mistaking me for some fellow commoner. "If you're looking to make some gold, go get that axe and bring me all the wood you can chop. The townspeople are always in need of firewood to use in their hearths.""

 VIETmisc.0075.t: "So Close, Yet So Far"
 VIETmisc.0075.desc: "Evening falls, and the temperature is rather chilly. I go to my home’s hearth to keep myself warm, and edge close to the fire.\n\nOn second thought, I am standing too close to the fire and getting too hot. I decide to take a few steps back.\n\nBut as soon as I do so, it seems I’m too far from the fire, and can feel the chill.\n\nI keep moving back and forth, trying to find the right distance between myself and the fire, but it’s either too hot or too cold."
 VIETmisc.0075.a: "I’ll stand closer to the fire - better to be a little too hot."
 VIETmisc.0075.b: "I’ll stand further away - it’s not that chilly tonight, anyways!"

 VIETmisc.0076.desc: "A few of my guardsmen reported seeing small fires in the distance at night. I thought perhaps they were hallucinating or playing a prank on me, until I decided to investigate one evening.\n\nAnd there, on the far end of the horizon, were indeed several small fires in the wilderness. They were barely visible, but visible nonetheless.\n\nIn the morning, I and a team of guards went forth to the area to investigate, but found no trace of hostile forces or bandits - in fact, no sign of human activity whatsoever."
 VIETmisc.0076.a: "Puzzling. Could this be some mystical phenomena?"

Taking such measures, however, will cost some money."
 VIETmisc.0077.a: "This man is very learned, so it would be good to heed his advice."
 VIETmisc.0077.b: "I unfortunately do not have funds to spare for such a thing."
 VIETmisc.0077.c: "What if he’s conspiring to help someone burn my house down?"
 VIETmisc.0077.info: "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Fire safety and prevention was in its infancy in the medieval period.

I notice one is sitting on the ground in the courtyard outside, using a stick to sketch various shapes and numbers in the dirt.\n\nCurious, I stroll over and ask him what he is doing. "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], don't interrupt me, please," he says, as he scratches his beard. "I'm doing important calculations here.

Even to this day, there are many techniques used to count large numbers using just fingers and hand gestures, which is formally known as dactylonomy.

No one had suspected this woman, given she seemed very pleasant and ordinary.\n\nHowever, my guard is a clever man, and while passing by this woman as she was buying produce in the market, he noticed she was finger counting in a manner dissimilar to the local custom.\n\nAfter some questioning and threats of torture, she admitted she was a spy from foreign lands. Unfortunately, she was killed trying to flee afterwards, so we don’t know for sure who was her employer or their intentions, but at least we got a bit of information off her and my guards have been put on alert."
 VIETmisc.0086.a: "Very good! That guard should be commended for his cunning."
 VIETmisc.0086.info: "#emphasis Historical Context:#! In the past and today, different cultures have different methods of counting using the body. For instance, some may count the knuckles as separate numbers, or use other body parts like the nose or ear to designate large numbers.

 VIETmisc.0087.t: "Tally Sticks"
 VIETmisc.0087.desc: "Two farmers living under my jurisdiction recently got into a major squabble. They were doing a business transaction, and transcribed the amounts of bartered goods on tally sticks. One farmer, however, tried to cheat the other by changing the amount of tallies on the stick. This was a stupid thing to do, as the other farmer had copies of the tally sticks made. Now, the fate of the cheating farmer is up to me to decide."

A rotten wood coffin was found, with a skeleton inside it. The clothes on the skeleton were worn and ripped, but these clothes clearly do not belong to any current style of fashion or dress. Regardless, the laborers and their overseers are at a loss about what to do, and have asked me if I had any ideas on what to do.\n\nAfter arriving at the site to confirm the situation with my own eyes, I believe the laborers are genuinely telling the truth. It now falls to me to decide what will happen with this skeleton."

I picked up the leaf and twirled it in my fingers; looking up, I mused out loud, perhaps a little absentmindedly, “Did the leaf truly come from that tree?”"
 VIETmisc.0148.a: "That was a good nap."
 VIETmisc.0149.t: "Wait - Do You Hear That?"
 VIETmisc.0149.desc: "I was taking a walk in the wilderness near my house with a few of my guards. We grew alarmed when we heard the noise of leaves crunching nearby. Could it be some sort of assassin or bandit?\n\nThankfully, our fears were for naught - it turned out the source of the noise was a couple mice moving about on top of some leaves. After noticing us, they scurried back under some bushes."
 VIETmisc.0149.a: "What a relief!"
 VIETmisc.0150.t: "Golden Leaf"
 VIETmisc.0150.desc: "A local notable presented me with a gift today. It is a leaf made out of pure gold, carefully crafted in an attractive, mesmerizing manner. Though a small gift, it is something anyone can appreciate - myself included."
 VIETmisc.0150.a: "I know where this would look good in my house!"
 VIETmisc.0151.t: "What's That?"
 VIETmisc.0151.desc: "I thought I saw something in a bush nearby. I ordered a couple of my guards to approach it. With weapons drawn, they moved cautiously towards the bush, which looked like it was even starting to wiggle around! However, once they got close enough, a couple birds flew out of the bush - perhaps they were stuck to it, or were engaging in some kind of business."
 VIETmisc.0151.a: "For a moment I thought it was… never mind."
 VIETmisc.0152.t: "Sprucing Things Up"
 VIETmisc.0152.desc: "My gardener informed me today that he thinks there is a section of my residence that could use some aesthetic improvements. When asked what he meant, he explained that a particular part of my courtyard could use a large number of carefully chosen bushes, which he can trim into various attractive shapes. It would make the current area, which looks relatively empty, a little more visually stimulating and appealing."
 VIETmisc.0152.a: "Splendid idea! I look forward to seeing what you do."
 VIETmisc.0152.b: "I see what you mean, but I don’t think we need it."
 VIETmisc.0153.t: "An Inconvenient Bush"
 VIETmisc.0153.desc: "I tripped and fell into a bush while taking a walk. If that weren’t bad enough, my clothes got tangled in the bush. After my guards successfully pulled me out of the bush, I had a number of scratches all over myself, and parts of my clothes had small holes in them."
 VIETmisc.0153.a: "Am I having another bad day again?"
 VIETmisc.0154.t: "Berry Good"
 VIETmisc.0154.desc: "While out and about in my realm, I spot a commoner huddled over a bush. I approach her, curious, and see that she is examining some berries in the bush.\n\n“Ah, forgive me for not noticing you, my [Root.Char.GetLadyLord]!” she says, before greeting me courteously. She is a friendly-looking, middle-aged woman with greying hair and a toothy grin. “Just as you have your important business to take care of, my important work today is that I’m on the hunt for some berries.”\n\n“Are those poisonous berries?” I ask. “They don’t look like any I recognize.”\n\n“Oh yes, be careful, these should not be eaten. But those over there, they are fine,” she says. “Very good for pastries.”"
 VIETmisc.0154.a: "We talk about various berries for a while, before we part ways."

 VIETmisc.0155.t: "Centenarian"
 VIETmisc.0155.desc: "I have received word that a village elder living nearby has recently attained the distinguished age of 100 years old. Over a century old! That is truly remarkable. It is exceedingly rare for someone to live for such a long time in this day and age. A few of my courtiers suggest that perhaps I should congratulate this elder somehow, if only to present myself favorably to the locals."
 VIETmisc.0155.a: "That’s nice, but why bother meeting a peasant?"
 VIETmisc.0155.b: "Yes! I must bestow upon this elder some fine gifts."
 VIETmisc.0155.c: "I'll visit the elder to congratulate them in person."
 VIETmisc.0156.t: "A Pot of Gold"
 VIETmisc.0156.desc: "I was outside, observing my gardener while he was at work. He was digging deeply into the ground near an old tree when he struck something hard. At first, we thought it was some sort of rock, but it turned out to be a small, sealed ceramic pot.\n\nCurious, we took it out and managed to break it open. Inside were a number of gold coins - we counted exactly 100 coins.\n\nUpon further investigation, based on the coins, it seems like this pot was buried a long time ago at this location by someone who never bothered to come back to take it. At any rate, my gardener, a jovial and easy-going fellow, says the pot and its coins now rightfully belong to me."
 VIETmisc.0156.a: "No, as you found it, it rightfully belongs to you!"
 VIETmisc.0156.b: "It is only fair that we split this find, my friend."
 VIETmisc.0156.c: "I'll take that from you, thank you very much."
 VIETmisc.0157.t: "The 100 Techniques of Love"
 VIETmisc.0157.desc: "“She was a wonderful harlot,” [horny.Custom('TitledFirstName')] says with a hearty laugh. “Never paid for a better woman to keep me company at night!”\n\nI am having a small feast with some courtiers, and the lusty man is recalling an encounter at a brothel he went to a while back. “She said she learned 100 different techniques in the art of love, and it was worth every coin I had to not only have her demonstrate every one of those techniques on me, but explain them to me as well. Who knew intimacy could be such a philosophical art?”\n\nSome of my courtiers listen attentively, fascinated (if not a little too excited), others look irritated and offended at his remarks, yet many just try to awkwardly avoid eye contact with him as he explains these supposed 100 techniques."
 VIETmisc.0157.a: "I’ll skillfully divert the conversation to safer topics."
 VIETmisc.0157.b: "Stop talking about these crude and vulgar things!"
 VIETmisc.0157.c: "This is all too fascinating! I should be taking notes."
 VIETmisc.0158.t: "100 Brave Youths"
 VIETmisc.0158.desc: "While traveling, I notice a sizable stone on the side of the road, one which is clearly carved by human hands. What is it doing here, I wonder? I get off my horse and come over to investigate. I see there is some sort of writing on the stone, but it is all worn out. There does appear to be some carvings of what appears to be people holding weapons, perhaps fighting.\n\nA few moments later, a traveler is passing by. He notes my attempts at deciphering what the stone is about, and tells me, “I live not too far from here - that stone, according to the elders, commemorates one hundred brave youths from here who, generations ago, sacrificed their lives to defeat the evil bandits who were terrorizing these lands. The battle took place right here.”"
 VIETmisc.0158.a: "What fascinating history! And what brave lads, too."
 VIETmisc.0159.t: "A Cat Lover"
 VIETmisc.0159.desc: "A spinster living not too far from here is reputed to have 100 pet cats. For as long as I’ve known about her, she’s never bothered anyone, though she is eccentric from what I’ve heard. Every time I’ve passed through town, though, and come across her, she’s been polite and respectful to me, but definitely mentally unstable and prone to rambling nonsense.\n\nSome of her neighbors are now complaining to me about her 100 cats. They say the creatures make all manner of frightening noises from her house. The town’s elders have no interest in doing anything about it, so her neighbors are bringing the matter before me. A few of them tell me they’re sure she is an evil sorceress, having all those cats around!"
 VIETmisc.0159.a: "That woman hasn’t committed any crime. Now begone!"
 VIETmisc.0159.b: "Well… if it’s a problem… force her to abandon her cats."
 VIETmisc.0159.c: "I don’t trust her. Imprison her and kill her cats just in case!"
 VIETmisc.0160.t: "A Miraculous Mother"
 VIETmisc.0160.desc: "I've heard that in a kingdom some distance from here, there is a woman who was reported to have given birth to 100 children in total! Not all at once, of course, but rather over the course of her life. How could someone go through all that? If such a woman exists, she must be a remarkable mother… or an incredible liar."
 VIETmisc.0160.a: "Amazing things like this happen all the time in this world."
 VIETmisc.0160.b: "I'm sure she just adopted a lot of orphans and lied about it."
 VIETmisc.0161.t: "Too Many Shoes!"
 VIETmisc.0161.desc: "I have realized to my horror that [spouse.Custom('FirstName')] has somehow acquired a collection of one hundred fancy shoes! At first it started off as a few shoes here, a few shoes there, but now, before I knew it, they're everywhere! Where did [spouse.GetSheHe] have the money to accumulate such vanities? There's now a lot of gossip about this matter, and it reflects poorly on me."
 VIETmisc.0161.a: "You must sell off some of those shoes. Now."
 VIETmisc.0161.b: "It's an odd habit, but it's none of my business."
 VIETmisc.0162.t: "One Hundred Spirits"
 VIETmisc.0162.desc: "Last night I had a strange dream, and I am not sure what to make of it.\n\nIn the dream, I was in a twisted vision of my home, where the rooms were dark and not lit at all. I saw many figures appear in my house, their pale faces were serenely neutral. They all began to dance - quietly, mysteriously, and, somehow, beautifully in an eerie way.\n\nI counted exactly one hundred people as I wandered this crowd. When I came to the last person, he told me in a pleasant but tired voice (as he slowly danced around me), "Thank you for hosting us. We are a hundred spirits. We will not cause any trouble."\n\nI woke up early in the morning, and, on instinct, I walked over to my window. Outside, on the edge of the horizon, as the sun was rising, I thought I saw some moving lights. Before I could count them, however, they vanished."
 VIETmisc.0162.a: "Maybe I’m seeing things, but that dream… what was that?"
 VIETmisc.0163.t: "Calipers"
 VIETmisc.0163.desc: "My servants found something very peculiar by my residence. A little off from the road nearby, there was a single wooden barrel, laying on its side. Inside were exactly one hundred calipers. Further investigation shows no leads on who owned the barrel and the calipers, and how it all got there in the first place."
 VIETmisc.0163.a: "I suppose some of my servants might make use of those calipers?"
 VIETmisc.0163.b: "If there's nothing else we could use them for, might as well sell them."
 VIETmisc.0164.t: "The Feud is Over"
 VIETmisc.0164.desc: "Today, I am attending a formal meeting between two local noble families. They had been feuding for over one hundred years - exactly one hundred years in fact, as precisely a century ago, on this day, the ancestors of these two families got into some sort of fight at a gathering which spiraled out of hand.\n\nI have previously served as a mediator for these two families to negotiate an agreement for peace, and now my efforts are bearing fruit. The feud had dragged on for too long, at any rate, and many people on both sides were hoping for it to end anyways."
 VIETmisc.0164.a: "I hope this is the start of a long period of peace between these two clans."

 VIETmisc.0005.desc.norse: "Sweet Njörun! What a dream! Excited, I leap out of my bed to share its contents with someone. Anyone! I see one of my thralls, still embraced by slumber, on the earthern floor of my longhouse. I nudge him with my foot and he rises; now standing and attentive.\n\nExcept... I have forgotten what had happened in my dream. I stumble over my words; struggling to recall any detail.\n\nWhy is it often too easy to forget what happens in the world of dreams?"
 VIETmisc.0005.a.norse: "Loki! He steals even my dreams. Oh well..."
 VIETmisc.0007.desc.t: "A Parent in Mourning"
 VIETmisc.0007.desc.norse: "One of my thralls was recently struck by tragedy when his only child was afflicted with sott. Hel's grasp was firm, as she quickly pulled the young girl to rest in the depths of Niflheim. Efforts made by other thralls to soothe the grieving father have proven ineffective. Even some of my own courtiers make attempts, but fail to assuage the man. Perhaps I should offer a few kind words as well."
 VIETmisc.0007.c.norse: "I need not say anything. Both man and child are but thralls."
 VIETmisc.0007.d.norse: "I will give this thrall a few days respite to pray to Eir for healing."
 VIETmisc.0010.t.norse: "The Yard House"
 VIETmisc.0010.desc.norse: "While attending to yard house business, my thoughts drifted from legal matters of the Hird to mundane matters of the home. I must have lost track of time while squatting in the garðhús, because after wiping my underside with wool, I realized I could no longer feel my legs. The numbness is so great, that I fear if I try and stand on my own, I could fall and injure myself."
 VIETmisc.0010.a.norse: "Where are my thralls? Help!"
 VIETmisc.0010.b.norse: "I can do this. If I just lean this way..."
 VIETmisc.0010.b.a.norse: "You manage to stand up in the yard house without any trouble"
 VIETmisc.0010.toast.b.fall.norse: "It appears you did not need your thralls' help after all"
 VIETmisc.0010.b.b.norse: "You fall forward, injuring your head on the pine barrier."
 VIETmisc.0010.toast.b.norse: "You injure yourself, you fool!"
 VIETmisc.0012.desc.norse: "There are rumors that a Draugr has been haunting a longhouse for the past few days. Some Thralls reported seeing the form of a man, known to be long dead, shuffling around the residence. While some believe he is here because his burial mound was distrubed by local children, others dismiss it as heimskur - complete nonsense."
 VIETmisc.0012.a.norse: "We need to check his mound. A draugr is nothing to trifle with."
 VIETmisc.0012.b.norse: "Heimskur, indeed. A children's story fit for children only."
 VIETmisc.0012.d.norse: "I fear no man nor draugr. I shall send it back to Hel!"
 VIETmisc.0018.t.norse: "Mimir's Late Visit"
 VIETmisc.0018.desc.norse: "A few days ago, I had an intense conversation with a member of my Hird. In a rare turn of events, they bested me with a clever insult. A slight, to which, I had no response.\n\nJust today, while reviewing military reports, an ingenious reply suddenly occured to me. Curse you Mimir! You may be the wisest of all the gods, but your aid comes far too late."
 VIETmisc.0018.a.norse: "Why does Mimir torture me so!"
 VIETmisc.0020.t.norse: "A Great Jól!"
 VIETmisc.0020.desc.norse: "I heard a great joke earlier today. One so good that it made me double over with laughter; dropping my skål of rømmegrøt in the process. When the bowl of porridge struck the ground, it sprayed thick cream onto the front of my courtier's trousers. This somehow enhanced the joke's effectiveness, but I now can't remember the joke."
 VIETmisc.0020.a.norse: "No matter. The laughter echoes still, and won't be forgotten!"
 VIETmisc.0022.t.norse: "And Another þing"
 VIETmisc.0022.desc.norse: "Another sunset, another assembly upon the burial mounds of my ancestors. The Karls petitioned, then argued, points of little consequence. Topics ranged from the mundane to the petty, as they often do. Even my most trusted councillors engaged in long-winded debates unworthy of my attention. This þing...this gathering of free men, is at the heart of how we maintain order. An ancient tradition, of which I'm sure, was borne to see me suffer."
 VIETmisc.0023.t.norse: "Got to Go, Got to Go Right Now!"
 VIETmisc.0023.desc.norse: "An important foreign envoy sits in the meeting hall of my longhouse conveying his lord's message. I shift in the high seat, listening to this talkative diplomat aimlessly drift from topic to topic.\n\n"Eggs have been laid and hatched in the time this man has occupied", I think to myself when a sudden bubbling occurs in my gut. I attempt to ignore it, but the bubbling intensifies; punctuated by sharp, soul-deadening pain. If I excuse myself now, I risk insulting this important guest. If I stay, I am sure to stain more than my reputation. A decision must be made...immediately!"
 VIETmisc.0023.a.norse: "To the garðhús!"
 VIETmisc.0023.b.norse: "I must...control my... NO!"
 VIETmisc.0023.b.a.norse: "You manage to control your bowels."
 VIETmisc.0023.toast.b.success.title.norse: "Your bowels maintain discipline!"
 VIETmisc.0023.toast.b.success.norse: "After the envoy leaves, you sprint to the yard house."
 VIETmisc.0023.b.b.norse: "Your bowels fail you."
 VIETmisc.0023.toast.b.failure.title.norse: "You've stained your trousers...and your honor!"
 VIETmisc.0023.toast.b.failure.norse: "You relieve yourself in view of the envoy. Embarrassing, yet preventable."
 VIETmisc.0027.desc.norse: "A murderer was brought to justice today. Surviving witnesses stated that he perpetrated the heinous crimes with delight. As the shackled man heard the charges leveled against him, he smiled and winked at those gathered for his trial. There was little debate as to what was to be done. The killer was duly sentenced to suffer a slow execution by our elected law giver. I confirmed the order, to which a few Huscarls prepared the man for the "Blood Eagle". The criminal had his back sliced open and his ribs and lungs removed while he still drew breath. As I was returning home, a councilor asks for my opinion on the manner of execution that was chosen."
 VIETmisc.0027.a.norse: "A fitting sacrifice to Odin."
 VIETmisc.0039.desc.norse: "I am in attendence of the union between a Jarl and a Karl. It is said that the pair have known each other since childhood; and seldom seen apart throughout.\n\nThe parents believe this coupling to have been destined by the gods. And despite the formal arrangement, many expect a successful life-long commitment between bride and groom."
 VIETmisc.0039.e.norse: "The thrall preparing mead, eyes me. I'll ensure nothing is left to imagination!"
