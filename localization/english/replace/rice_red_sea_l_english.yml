You are too bloodthirsty, they said.\n\nCertainly, I have been humbled by my recent setbacks, but do they not realize the extent of my zeal and faith, to control these hinterlands of the Eastern Desert for the glory of the Caliphate?

For all the ruthlessness my enemies ascribe to me, I am still a scholar at heart, one who has studied deeply the #italic Hadith#! and who can recite poetry without pause. My travels took me all over the lands nominally ruled by the Abbasids, from Fustat where I studied for many years to the spiritual center in Kairouan.

 red_sea.0022.desc: "Through a series of events, I stumbled into the Eastern Desert, that patch of arid land between the Nile and the Red Sea. With my reputation as an erudite and pious scholar, I attracted a large following who helped me establish a base in [wadi_allaqi_region.GetNameNoTier], where we began large scale mining operations, most prominently of gold; the profits were immense. However, my presence was seen as a threat by the Muslim governors of Egypt, even though I and my warriors held off the infidels to the south.\n\nEventually, I involved myself in the petty squabbles of these Sudanese chieftains and ravaged their lands and raided their settlements for slaves, and at the same time also clashed many times with the governor of Egypt, [ibn_tulun.Custom('TitledFirstName')]. Alas, I bit more than I could chew, and was driven back to my base in the mountains of [wadi_allaqi_region.GetNameNoTier], which are host to many lucrative mines.\n\nNow, after licking my wounds, I will prepare to reassert myself as a local power. Some warn me to not be too foolhardy, too greedy, or too bloodthirsty, but I am older and wiser now. I have thought carefully about my next steps."

As ruler of Egypt, [ibn_tulun.GetSheHe] is irate at the fact that I control these lands along the Red Sea and the Eastern Desert, and will scheme against me at every step I take. Though I have defeated [ibn_tulun.GetHerHim] twice already, I must be wary and vigilant, for just as much as I am a thorn on [ibn_tulun.GetHerHis] side, so is [ibn_tulun.GetSheHe] a thorn on my side."

Swallowing one’s pride isn’t easy, but I believe [ibn_tulun.GetSheHe] and I share interests and mutual enemies, so if we can reconcile our differences, maybe we can prosper and triumph against the infidels to the south."
 red_sea.0023.desc.focus_build: "\n\nI will focus my efforts on developing the mining infrastructure of [wadi_allaqi_region.GetNameNoTier]. I must concede that some of my men were right when they previously told me I was too reckless in my actions. I learned my lesson.

These men have dedicated their entire lives to mastering astronomical knowledge and applying it to travel between the Indian Ocean ports.\n\nI notice these #italic mu’allim#! have a dismissive attitude towards the #italic rubban#! - local ship captains who have experience mainly sailing in only the Red Sea. However, many here know that the #italic rubban#! are full of lore about local geography, such as various reefs and islands in the Red Sea and how to traverse them. Ultimately, it seems these #italic mu’allim#! see the knowledge of the #italic rubban#! as inferior to theirs."

One such vessel has just washed up on shore in my territory; it has a large haul of loot, and the ship's owners and crew are all foreign heathens. My soldiers have detained them - their captain is suspicious of these traders' motivations, as they could be spies or degenerates from other realms! He suggests I enslave these barbarians and take their goods. After all, it's common practice in this region, so I consider his advice carefully."
 red_sea.0031.a: "Yes, enslave the survivors and take their goods."
 red_sea.0031.b: "Enslavement is too much. Let's just take their goods."
 red_sea.0031.c: "No need to be cruel. Escort them to the nearest port."
 red_sea.0032.t: "Chinese Ceramics"
 red_sea.0032.desc: "Chinese ceramics are a popular luxury item in the Red Sea, despite being from so far away - or, perhaps, that is precisely why they're so popular. I was browsing the local market for some when I thought of [ceramic_lover.Custom('TitledFirstName')], who recently expressed much interest in them as lovely house decorations. Perhaps I can show my generous and thoughtful side?"
 red_sea.0032.a: "Of course! Buying some as a gift would be a good idea."
 red_sea.0032.b: "I would prefer I buy some Chinese ceramics for myself."
 red_sea.0032.c: "Surely [ceramic_lover.GetSheHe] has time to buy ceramics without my help."
 red_sea.0033.t: "A Pompous Pilgrim"
 red_sea.0033.desc: "A prominent Muslim nobleman from afar is partaking in the Hajj pilgrimage, traveling through the Red Sea route, and is stopping through my lands. Some in my court suggest that I should host this man while he is here - once he returns from his pilgrimage and travels back across the Red Sea, who knows what good things he might say about me? However, it is known that this man is something of a snob with pretentious tastes. Ironic, isn’t it, that he is on a pilgrimage and does not appear to show any humility?"
 red_sea.0033.a: "I have no interest in hosting such a pompous man."
 red_sea.0033.b: "Of course! Prepare a magnificent feast in his honor!"
 red_sea.0034.t: "Gazelles"
 red_sea.0034.desc: "Gazelles have lived in the arid lands surrounding the Red Sea for as long as anyone can remember. They are a peaceful, docile creature, and a number of them have recently moved not too far from my residence. What more, these gazelles seem rather tame, and don’t seem to fear my presence too much."
 red_sea.0034.a: "A sign from [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]! Let them graze here as long as they wish."
 red_sea.0034.b: "This should make it easy to lure them to be hunted for food."
 red_sea.0034.c: "I don’t like them - find a way to chase these pests away!"
 red_sea.0035.t: "Ostrich Eggs"
 red_sea.0035.desc: "Ostriches can be found throughout the regions around the Red Sea. Traditionally in these parts, ostrich eggs are used as containers for small items, or even as an alternative to waterskins, and they are a fairly popular export. I was given one such egg, decorated in beautiful, colorful patterns, as a gift today by some locals under my rule."
 red_sea.0035.a: "A splendid gift!"
 red_sea.0036.t: "Hyena Attack"
 red_sea.0036.desc: "I control some territory in the Eastern Desert of Egypt, which is often used by caravans of merchants and pilgrims traveling between the Nile River and the Red Sea. Recently, one such caravan, owned by a prominent local merchant, was attacked by a band of hyenas while they were camping at night, as often happens in this region. Such hyena attacks generally don’t cause much harm to people, but can be disruptive to business. The merchant was trading in foodstuff, in fact, and the hyenas ate quite a number of his products! Anyways, since this man is relatively well-known, perhaps it may do to show some generosity and assist him after this personal setback."
 red_sea.0036.a: "He’s rich already, I’m sure he’ll be fine."
 red_sea.0036.b: "I won’t shy away from being generous!"
 red_sea.0037.t: "The Seasick Pilgrim"
 red_sea.0037.desc: "I am hosting a prominent Muslim aristocrat who just finished his pilgrimage to Mecca, and is now journeying home. As I ask him to tell me stories of how his adventure went, he tells me the most frightening part of the journey was crossing the Red Sea by ferry boat.\n\n“I had never been out at sea before!” he explains. “I had to cling onto my slave to prevent myself from vomiting the whole time. She was born in a coastal land, you see, and used to being on a boat, and she laughed at me for my weakness - I might have whipped the feisty girl then and there had it not been for my fondness for her… or maybe I was just too queasy to respond....”"
 red_sea.0037.a: "It is not easy for those who have never sailed before!"
 red_sea.0037.b: "Be glad your slave is loyal and helped you in that ordeal."
 red_sea.0037.c: "I would’ve laughed too - you look like a pitiful, weak man."
 red_sea.0038.t: "Red Sea Coral"
 red_sea.0038.desc: "Today I decided to take a walk by the beach along the Red Sea. In this part of my territory, there are a number of coral reefs. How beautiful they are - a stunning feast for the eyes!"
 red_sea.0038.a: "I should do this more."
 red_sea.0039.t: "Encounter Along the Red Sea"
 red_sea.0039.desc: "The Red Sea has been inhabited for centuries, both by roving bands of nomads as well as colonies from larger kingdoms. Earlier today, when traveling through a part of my realm along the Red Sea coast, we came across what appeared to be an old structure of some kind along the shore, which was a small, abandoned hut or mud and reeds. Who knows whether it was built a decade ago, or centuries ago?\n\nWhile resting there, a large party of herdsmen passed through. They were traveling to a nearby town to trade with the local merchants, and offered to exchange some of their goods with us."
 red_sea.0039.a: "I’ll purchase a few of your goats, and some milk and butter."
 red_sea.0039.b: "Those ostrich eggs look beautiful - can I use them to store water?"
 red_sea.0039.c: "Your slave there looks impressive. How much to buy?"
 red_sea.0039.d: "The camels you have look quite sturdy and strong!"
 red_sea.0039.e: "I have no interest in trading, but good luck on your trip."
