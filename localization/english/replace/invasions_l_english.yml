 almohad.1002.desc: "The religious movement known as the Almohads have sallied forth from their headquarters, intent on "reclaiming the Maghreb from the disbelievers", by force if necessary!\n\nTheir leader, [ibn_tumart.Custom('TitledFirstName')] was once turned away from numerous places of learning for being — quite frankly — annoying in [ibn_tumart.GetHerHis] insistence on dogmatic practices, However, [ibn_tumart.GetSheHe] has now found a strong core of followers and declared [ibn_tumart.GetHerselfHimself] nothing less than the Madhi!"
 almohad.1003.desc: "The Almohads' founder, [ibn_tumart.Custom('TitledFirstName')], has passed, and with that one would hope that [ibn_tumart.GetHerHis] movement would be consigned to history. If only we were so lucky.\n\nInstead, a new leader has risen! [al_mumin.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has not only held the tribes together, [al_mumin.GetSheHe] has gathered #EMP more#! people to [al_mumin.GetHerHis] banner!"
