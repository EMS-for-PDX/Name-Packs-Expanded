 party_baron.1001.t: "$party_baron_header$"
 party_baron.1001.desc: "The name of a the lesser nobles seems to be on everybody's lips. I keep hearing about how [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is oh-so great to be around, how [party_baron.GetSheHe] makes everyone feel at ease, and how [party_baron.GetSheHe] hosts the #EMP best#! feasts.\n\nEveryone knows [party_baron.GetHerHim] and can vouch for his friendliness and generosity — at least that's what they're eager to claim."
 party_baron.1001.a: "Perhaps I could learn a thing or two from [party_baron.GetHerHis] popularity..."
 party_baron.1001.b: "But #EMP I#! am the one who should be heaped with praise!"
 party_baron.1001.c: "It sounds like I should get to know this [party_baron.GetWomanMan]!"
 party_baron.1001.c.tt: "Write a letter to the [party_baron.GetTitleAsName]"

 party_baron.1002.opening: "[party_baron.Custom2('AppropriateGreetingPositive', ROOT.Char)]"
 party_baron.1002.desc: "I thank you for your kind words of greetings! It feels good to hear from someone who truly appreciates that true joy is the one you bring to others.\n\nI hope to one day host you as my honored guest, and although it is presumptuous of me to say so, I hope you may one day come to consider me a friend."
 party_baron.1002.a: "[party_baron.GetSheHe|U] seems very pleasant, even by letter!"

 party_baron.1003.desc: "It feels as if I blinked for a moment, and missed it entirely, but [party_baron.Custom('FirstName')] has gone from [party_baron.GetHerHis] lowly barony, to being my [party_baron_header.GetTitleAsName]...\n\nThe world has turned upside down faster than I could imagine."
 party_baron.1003.a: "At least I now have a generous [party_baron.GetTitleAsName]."
 party_baron.1003.b: "Let us just forget all those things I said..."

 party_baron.2001.t: "$party_baron_header$"
 party_baron.2001.negative: "Without any encouragement or approval, it seems that [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has taken the initiative to speak to [vassal.Custom2('RelationToMe', ROOT.Char )] about me!\n\n[party_baron.GetSheHe|U] apparently praised me endlessly, but that merely makes me #EMP more#! suspicious of [party_baron.GetHerHis] motivations!"
 party_baron.2001.positive: "It seems that [party_baron.Custom('ShortName')], entirely of [party_baron.GetHerHis] own initiative, has spoken to [vassal.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char )] about me.\n\nIt might have been cause for concern, if not for the fact that [vassal.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] now seems far more friendly and supportive!"
 party_baron.2001.a_positive: "An impressive effort!"
 party_baron.2001.a_negative: "As long as everything is under control for now..."
 party_baron.2001.b_negative: "I am the one who should be admired and listened to in the first place!"
 party_baron.2001.b_positive: "As is only right. I am pretty great."

 party_baron.2002.t: "$party_baron_header$"
 party_baron.2002.desc: "At a feast, my eyes meet those of [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] as [party_baron.GetSheHe] is speaking with [new_friend.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char )]. Despite the obvious breach of decorum, [party_baron.GetSheHe] gestures me over.\n\n"[ROOT.Char.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]! You know [new_friend.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')], of course, but I think you should spend some more time together. You have so much in common!""
 party_baron.2002.a: "I suppose I don't know [new_friend.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')] as well as I might."
 party_baron.2002.b: "Oh, I have more than enough acquaintances as it is."

 party_baron.2003.desc: "It came to my attention that [owner.Custom2('YourCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] has been plotting to murder you!\n\nWorry not, however, because I spoke to [owner.GetHerHim] and made [owner.GetHerHim] see the error of [owner.GetHerHis] ways. Murder is truly abhorrent, wouldn't you agree?"
 party_baron.2003.a: "Thank you for... saving my life?"
 party_baron.2003.repentant_cannot_scheme: "For as long as [owner.Custom('ShortName')] is repentant, [owner.GetSheHe] cannot start [hostile_schemes|E] against you"
 party_baron.2003.b: "[owner.GetSheHe|U] has been plotting to do #EMP what?!#!"
 party_baron.2003.c: "How, exactly, did this plot just "come to [party_baron.GetHerHis] attention"...?"

 party_baron.2004.t: "$party_baron_header$"
 party_baron.2004.desc: "It is impossible to tell whether [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is drunk, or merely intoxicated by the spirit of the celebration going on all around [party_baron.GetHerHim]. Whatever it is, I can feel it too as soon as [party_baron.GetSheHe] pulls me into a hug.\n\n"You know," [party_baron.GetSheHe] says, "I really think you're one of the best friends I have."\n\nThe rest of the evening, I mostly watch [party_baron.GetHerHim] in [party_baron.GetHerHis] revels. I am starting to believe I might understand [party_baron.GetHerHim] better than any of the people toasting [party_baron.GetHerHim]."
 party_baron.2004.a: "You too, [party_baron.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]..."

 party_baron.2005.t: "$party_baron_header$"
 party_baron.2005.desc: "I am surprised, but pleased when [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] appears at my court. Even more so when [party_baron.GetSheHe] wants to speak, just the two of us.\n\n"I didn't want this to be said at a feast or a celebration." [party_baron.GetSheHe|U] seems unusually serious, that lighthearted smile missing for once. "I cannot describe how much you mean to me. I have many friends, but none other such as you. I hope we keep that friendship until the end of our days.""
 party_baron.2005.a: ""Me too, [party_baron.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]. Me too."

 party_baron.2006.desc: "Having been invited to a feast for "a very special occasion," I had to see [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] celebration for myself. What a night it was.\n\nI can scarce remember being happier, and now it feels as if I have regained some of my lust for life!"
 party_baron.2006.a: "Look out, world!"
 party_baron.2006.b: "It was nothing special."

 party_baron.2007.desc: "Even in the middle of a war, [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] finds ways to get up to [party_baron.GetHerHis] usual tricks. As I am surveying my army, [party_baron.GetSheHe] comes riding up to me at the head of [party_baron.GetHerHis] own small host!\n\n"I thought we could do with every hand we could get, so I talked to some people, and they turn out to be eager to join as volunteers!"\n\nVolunteers...? Should I be asking where these soldiers came from?"
 party_baron.2007.a: "This is exactly what I need!"
 party_baron.2007.b: "To #EMP help#!, you should have brought me #EMP professionals!#!"
 party_baron.2007.b_flavor: "Oh. Oh, you will...?"

 party_baron.3001.t: "$party_baron_header$"
 party_baron.3001.desc: "People are head over heels for [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')], and I just don't understand why! [party_baron.GetSheHe|U] is not that great. All [party_baron.GetSheHe] does is act friendly and celebrate the good things about the people [party_baron.GetSheHe] meets! Yes, even having disagreements with [party_baron.GetHerHim] can be pleasant and friendly, and [party_baron.GetSheHe] stands for [party_baron.GetHerHis] convictions while trying to understand yours, but that's still not...\n\nMy point is, why do they love [party_baron.GetHerHim] so much?!"
 party_baron.3001.a: "I will show them who's worthy of awe!"
 party_baron.3001.b: "Perhaps I am being a little harsh..."

 party_baron.3002.t: "$party_baron_header$"
 party_baron.3002.desc: "So it is not enough that [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is beloved by all, #EMP I#! must love [party_baron.GetHerHim] as well?\n\nSeveral of my vassals have signed a writ requesting that I cease speaking foul words about that useless [party_baron.GetTitleAsName]!"
 party_baron.3002.a: "Oh, I'll show those uppity cretins some "foul words.""
 party_baron.3002.b: "It doesn't hurt to be a little gentler. In public."

 party_baron.3003.desc: "Even after everything I have said about [party_baron.GetHerHim], [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] remains undeterred. [party_baron.GetSheHe|U] even dares approach me at a feast, alone.\n\n"I have a feeling you don't like me very much." I snort. [party_baron.GetSheHe|U] can say that again. But of course instead [party_baron.GetSheHe] continues without flinching. "Could we talk for a moment?"\n\nEverything that happens next is a blur, but it turned into one of the best feasts of my life. I must admit, perhaps I was wrong about the [party_baron.GetTitleAsName] after all..."
 party_baron.3003.a: "To think you would get me in the end, [party_baron.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]!"
 party_baron.3003.b: "No! Nothing has changed!"

 party_baron.3004.desc: "This has gone on long enough! The fact that [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] keeps being elevated as some beacon of everything good in humanity is driving me mad!\n\nWhatever manipulative spell [party_baron.GetSheHe] has the realm under needs to be broken."
 party_baron.3004.a: "#EMP [party_baron.GetSheHe|U]#! needs to be broken!"
 party_baron.3004.b: "Am I... going too far?"

 party_baron.4001.desc: "The loss of [previous_character.Custom2('YourCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] has been hard to accept. [previous_character.GetSheHe|U] was a good friend, and you should be proud of the [previous_character.GetWomanMan] [previous_character.GetSheHe] was.\n\nThis must be a difficult time for you, but know that you have my support!"
 party_baron.4001.a: "Thank you for your kind words."

 party_baron.4002.opening: "[party_baron.Custom2('AppropriateGreeting', ROOT.Char)]"
 party_baron.4002.desc: "I understand that you do not like me. That is your right. But I do not see why you continue to be wicked and hostile when I attempt to be as friendly and as courteous as I can.\n\nWe have had many opportunities to settle this, but now I am asking you for the last time. Please, let us simply... be friends."
 party_baron.4002.a: "How dare [party_baron.GetSheHe]? How dare [party_baron.GetSheHe]!"

 party_baron.9001.t: "The End of a Feast"
 party_baron.9001.desc: "[party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is a stark reminder that no matter how much we enjoy life, and no matter how much joy we bring to this world, it will all come to an end eventually."
 party_baron.9001.a: "This world will be less without [party_baron.GetHerHim]."
 party_baron.9001.a.tt: "[party_baron.Custom('ShortName')] is celebrating in [party_baron.GetFaith.PositiveAfterLife]"
 party_baron.9001.b: "It seems [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DeathDeityName] did not fall for [party_baron.GetHerHis] false smile."
 party_baron.9001.b.tt: "[party_baron.Custom('ShortName')] is finally gone for good."

 party_baron.9003.t: "$party_baron_header$"
 party_baron.9003.desc_positive: "I cannot believe how lucky I am, to have this [party_baron.GetWomanMan] at my side. I never thought I would feel as happy as I did on my wedding day, like a giddy peasant [ROOT.Char.Custom('GirlBoy')]. And [party_baron.Custom('FirstName')] seemed radiant.\n\nWhen [party_baron.GetSheHe] looks me in the eyes and says [party_baron.GetSheHe] can think of no greater joy than to be with me forever, I believe [party_baron.GetHerHim]."
 party_baron.9003.desc_negative: "Perhaps this is how it was always going to end. For all my loathing and envy, I could still not resist [party_baron.GetHerHis] charm.\n\n[party_baron.Custom('FirstName')] seems to have been certain this was always going to happen. And now that we are wed, [party_baron.GetSheHe] seems happier than ever."
 party_baron.9003.a_positive: "I am yours, my love!"
 party_baron.9003.a_negative: "You got me at last, you absolute charmer!"
