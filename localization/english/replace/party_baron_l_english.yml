 party_baron.1001.desc: "The name of a the lesser nobles seems to be on everybody's lips. I keep hearing about how [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is oh-so great to be around, how [party_baron.GetSheHe] makes everyone feel at ease, and how [party_baron.GetSheHe] hosts the #EMP best#! feasts.\n\nEveryone knows [party_baron.GetHerHim] and can vouch for his friendliness and generosity — at least that's what they're eager to claim."

 party_baron.1001.c.tt: "Write a letter to the [party_baron.Custom('TitleAsName')]"

 party_baron.1003.desc: "It feels as if I blinked for a moment, and missed it entirely, but [party_baron.Custom('FirstName')] has gone from [party_baron.GetHerHis] lowly barony, to being my [party_baron_header.Custom('TitleAsName')]...\n\nThe world has turned upside down faster than I could imagine."
 party_baron.1003.a: "At least I now have a generous [party_baron.Custom('TitleAsName')]."

 party_baron.2001.negative: "Without any encouragement or approval, it seems that [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has taken the initiative to speak to [vassal.Custom2('RelationToMe', ROOT.Char )] about me!\n\n[party_baron.GetSheHe|U] apparently praised me endlessly, but that merely makes me #EMP more#! suspicious of [party_baron.GetHerHis] motivations!"
 party_baron.2001.positive: "It seems that [party_baron.Custom('ShortName')], entirely of [party_baron.GetHerHis] own initiative, has spoken to [vassal.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char )] about me.\n\nIt might have been cause for concern, if not for the fact that [vassal.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] now seems far more friendly and supportive!"

 party_baron.2002.desc: "At a feast, my eyes meet those of [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] as [party_baron.GetSheHe] is speaking with [new_friend.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char )]. Despite the obvious breach of decorum, [party_baron.GetSheHe] gestures me over.\n\n"[ROOT.Char.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]! You know [new_friend.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')], of course, but I think you should spend some more time together. You have so much in common!""
 party_baron.2002.a: "I suppose I don't know [new_friend.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')] as well as I might."

 party_baron.2003.repentant_cannot_scheme: "For as long as [owner.Custom('ShortName')] is repentant, [owner.GetSheHe] cannot start [hostile_schemes|E] against you"

 party_baron.2004.desc: "It is impossible to tell whether [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is drunk, or merely intoxicated by the spirit of the celebration going on all around [party_baron.GetHerHim]. Whatever it is, I can feel it too as soon as [party_baron.GetSheHe] pulls me into a hug.\n\n"You know," [party_baron.GetSheHe] says, "I really think you're one of the best friends I have."\n\nThe rest of the evening, I mostly watch [party_baron.GetHerHim] in [party_baron.GetHerHis] revels. I am starting to believe I might understand [party_baron.GetHerHim] better than any of the people toasting [party_baron.GetHerHim]."
 party_baron.2004.a: "You too, [party_baron.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]..."

 party_baron.2005.desc: "I am surprised, but pleased when [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] appears at my court. Even more so when [party_baron.GetSheHe] wants to speak, just the two of us.\n\n"I didn't want this to be said at a feast or a celebration." [party_baron.GetSheHe|U] seems unusually serious, that lighthearted smile missing for once. "I cannot describe how much you mean to me. I have many friends, but none other such as you. I hope we keep that friendship until the end of our days.""
 party_baron.2005.a: ""Me too, [party_baron.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]. Me too."

 party_baron.2006.desc: "Having been invited to a feast for "a very special occasion," I had to see [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] celebration for myself. What a night it was.\n\nI can scarce remember being happier, and now it feels as if I have regained some of my lust for life!"

 party_baron.2007.desc: "Even in the middle of a war, [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] finds ways to get up to [party_baron.GetHerHis] usual tricks. As I am surveying my army, [party_baron.GetSheHe] comes riding up to me at the head of [party_baron.GetHerHis] own small host!\n\n"I thought we could do with every hand we could get, so I talked to some people, and they turn out to be eager to join as volunteers!"\n\nVolunteers...? Should I be asking where these soldiers came from?"

 party_baron.3001.desc: "People are head over heels for [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')], and I just don't understand why! [party_baron.GetSheHe|U] is not that great. All [party_baron.GetSheHe] does is act friendly and celebrate the good things about the people [party_baron.GetSheHe] meets! Yes, even having disagreements with [party_baron.GetHerHim] can be pleasant and friendly, and [party_baron.GetSheHe] stands for [party_baron.GetHerHis] convictions while trying to understand yours, but that's still not...\n\nMy point is, why do they love [party_baron.GetHerHim] so much?!"

 party_baron.3002.desc: "So it is not enough that [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is beloved by all, #EMP I#! must love [party_baron.GetHerHim] as well?\n\nSeveral of my vassals have signed a writ requesting that I cease speaking foul words about that useless [party_baron.Custom('TitleAsName')]!"

 party_baron.3003.desc: "Even after everything I have said about [party_baron.GetHerHim], [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] remains undeterred. [party_baron.GetSheHe|U] even dares approach me at a feast, alone.\n\n"I have a feeling you don't like me very much." I snort. [party_baron.GetSheHe|U] can say that again. But of course instead [party_baron.GetSheHe] continues without flinching. "Could we talk for a moment?"\n\nEverything that happens next is a blur, but it turned into one of the best feasts of my life. I must admit, perhaps I was wrong about the [party_baron.Custom('TitleAsName')] after all..."
 party_baron.3003.a: "To think you would get me in the end, [party_baron.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]!"

 party_baron.3004.desc: "This has gone on long enough! The fact that [party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] keeps being elevated as some beacon of everything good in humanity is driving me mad!\n\nWhatever manipulative spell [party_baron.GetSheHe] has the realm under needs to be broken."

 party_baron.9001.desc: "[party_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is a stark reminder that no matter how much we enjoy life, and no matter how much joy we bring to this world, it will all come to an end eventually."

 party_baron.9001.b.tt: "[party_baron.Custom('ShortName')] is finally gone for good."

 party_baron.9003.desc_positive: "I cannot believe how lucky I am, to have this [party_baron.GetWomanMan] at my side. I never thought I would feel as happy as I did on my wedding day, like a giddy peasant [ROOT.Char.Custom('GirlBoy')]. And [party_baron.Custom('FirstName')] seemed radiant.\n\nWhen [party_baron.GetSheHe] looks me in the eyes and says [party_baron.GetSheHe] can think of no greater joy than to be with me forever, I believe [party_baron.GetHerHim]."
 party_baron.9003.desc_negative: "Perhaps this is how it was always going to end. For all my loathing and envy, I could still not resist [party_baron.GetHerHis] charm.\n\n[party_baron.Custom('FirstName')] seems to have been certain this was always going to happen. And now that we are wed, [party_baron.GetSheHe] seems happier than ever."
