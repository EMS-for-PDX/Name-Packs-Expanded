Suddenly, one of the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] says, “Oh dear, this manuscript won’t do at all. The colors of the illustrations aren’t good.”\n\nPerhaps I should suggest a better source of pigment to illustrate the manuscript."

 VIETold.0013.b: "Some might care, but personally, I think it’s fine you’re being lazy."

 VIETold.0014.t: "Vanity!"
 VIETold.0014.desc: "Today, a merchant from one of the eastern Mediterranean realms is visiting my household. To our utter shock, the man insisted that his servants cut the food up into pieces and then eating the pieces with this thing called a “fork”. These foreign manners are nothing but sheer vanity!"
 VIETold.0014.a: "Indeed! This is a mark of pride."
 VIETold.0014.b: "We should respect different customs, even if they are rather arrogant."
 VIETold.0014.info: "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Although forks had been found in Europe (particularly the Roman Empire) since ancient times, the personal table fork only gained popularity in the Byzantine Empire and the Middle East during the early medieval period. The rest of Europe was slow to adopt the fork at first, seeing it as a symbol of excess and vanity, and in some places in Europe it wasn't even until the 18th century that personal forks became widespread."
 VIETold.0015.t: "Sour Kefir"

 VIETold.0018.t: "Bad Baklava"
 VIETold.0018.desc: "Oh! [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] have mercy on me, I should’ve never eaten that! It was definitely a bad idea buying that cheap baklava from the baklava merchant. It turned out to be really old and spoiled - no wonder he sold it at such a low price!"

 VIETold.0019.t: "Scammed"

 VIETold.0019.a: "Haha, that scam! Everyone knows about that one."
 VIETold.0019.b: "Tell me who did it. I’ll find and punish them!"
 VIETold.0019.c: "I also got deceived by that con several times myself."
 VIETold.0019.info: "#emphasis Historical Context:#! In the old days, there was a common scam where a conman would put a cat in a bag and pretend it was a piglet; they would then trick their victim into buying it without checking what it really was.

 VIETold.0020.t: "An Unscrupulous Servant"
 VIETold.0020.desc: "I’ve received damning evidence revealing that one of my servants is one of the more well-to-do smugglers in the region. No wonder he always seems so happy and well-to-do compared to the others!"

 VIETold.0020.b: "Expel him from my castle, but do no more."

 VIETold.0021.desc: "“A true relic of the city’s patron saint! See for yourself!” The merchant smiles through his crooked teeth as he shows me the bone.\n\nAs I observe the bone, its ridges and its texture, the merchant continues, “This belonged to our saint, certainly, and I will give it to you for an affordable price.”"
 VIETold.0021.a: "This will impress quite a lot of people. I'll buy this holy relic!"
 VIETold.0021.b: "No thanks. I don't have any need for this kind of object."
 VIETold.0021.c: "That’s obviously a pig’s bone. What a fraud!"
 VIETold.0022.t: "Deceived!"
 VIETold.0022.desc: "I happily show everyone the relic I bought for cheap, but one of my servants, a clever and sharp old lady, laughs as she proves that it is merely a pig’s bone.\n\n"My, my," the elderly servant says. "It's a classic scam! I hope you're not going to be as gullible next time, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]!"\n\nAlas, I was deceived!"
 VIETold.0022.a: "Throw away that useless thing, I have no need for it now."

 VIETold.0029.t: "Prosperous Rule"
 VIETold.0029.desc: "Throughout the land, the peasants are singing songs in praise of my just rule. My capable leadership has made the realm a prosperous and affluent place."

 VIETold.0029.b: "Justice is blind!" 
 VIETold.0030.t: "Calm Down?"

 VIETold.0030.a: "I rule my realm as I please. Who cares for their opinions?"
 VIETold.0030.b: "A good ruler listens to others. Maybe I should control myself."
 VIETold.0030.c: "But... I want people to trust and love me."
 VIETold.0030.d: "In fact, my enemies fear me too!"
 VIETold.0031.t: "Patience"
 VIETold.0031.desc: "Being a very down to earth person, I always try to hear others’ opinions before making a decision, because..."

 VIETold.0033.t: "The Orphan"
 VIETold.0033.desc: "One of my $knight_culture_player_plural_no_tooltip_lowercase$, who was impoverished, had recently died, leaving behind an orphaned child. I really feel pity for the unfortunate youth, who has no family left. I’ll try to find the child a good place to live."

 VIETold.1003.desc: "One of my courtiers has lately refused to eat anything with cabbage. When questioned why, I was told: "Cabbage? Oh dear... you know it is peasant's food - it is like water to them. Why would a person of high status such as ourselves consume such a lowly, filthy plant?""

My physician, [physician.Custom('TitledFirstName')] said I should treat it with chicory, which I hate because of its bitter taste. Though I won't be eating it, and only applying it on the affected skin, having to deal with it is just annoying."

 VIETold.1011.t: "Bitter Greens"

 VIETold.1014.t: "Stimulating Vegetables"

 VIETold.2009.desc: "A physical manifestation of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] supposedly appeared in a village nearby, and blessed a few locals, before ascending into the heavens. Few of the official clergy seem to believe these peasants' claims, saying it is misunderstandings of the ignorant, but the peasants don't care and have built altars where these incidents occurred."
 VIETold.2009.a: "A good omen! Encourage the clergy to support the village."

 VIETold.2013.t: "Love Under Moon"
 VIETold.2013.desc: "The book I read looked like a typical vapid romance at first. Instead, it was an epic love story with drama, comedy and tragedy, that raised poignant, difficult questions about human morality and mortality. Immensely moved, I now find it hard to fall asleep at night as I think about the characters I'd grown to love and their bittersweet fates. Will I ever read a story like that again?"

 VIETold.2014.t: "A Simple Story"
 VIETold.2014.desc: "I was watching a play a traveling troupe was performing. Though it was a short and simple love story without much drama or conflict, the characters were likeable and realistic in their motivations and desires. Despite its simplicity and lack of tension, many in the audience loved the story."

 VIETold.2015.desc: "A poet is reciting a tale about a historical event long ago before me and an audience. I realize he just made a mistake, and there are some inaccuracies in his retelling of what happened!\n\nPerhaps I should do my duty and inform this poet that his knowledge of the past is faulty, and will cause others to misunderstand those who came before us. On the other hand, maybe people will misinterpret my good intentions as haughtiness. What to do...?"

 VIETold.2015.b: "Correct him - history should not be lies!"

 VIETold.2016.desc: "I was idly reading a book about historical events in ancient times. Suddenly, when I came across a particular section, disjointed images and scenes flashed before my mind, as if I was really there. My servants found me on the ground moments later, having fainted.

 VIETold.2017.t: "Deeds of Heroes"
 VIETold.2017.desc: "I recently took the time to read through various books explaining the exploits and deeds of ancient heroes and warriors. It was informative, and helped me to better understand:"

 VIETold.2024.desc: "I was bored at home with nothing to do one day, so I decided to take a walk around when I overheard some muffled sounds coming from a room. I snuck over and opened the door slightly, and peeked inside. One of my maids and one of my manservants were making love and in the throes of passion, oblivious to the world around them! Though young, they should know better."
 VIETold.2024.a: "Barge in and order them to stop doing this in public."
 VIETold.2024.b: "Secretly watch them eagerly but don't tell them."

 VIETold.2027.t: "Deviant Lands"
 VIETold.2027.desc: "I have heard that there are lands far away from where I live, where the practice of marriage between siblings is common and not just accepted, but actively embraced and encouraged throughout society, from the highest of royalty to the humblest of peasants. Could such communities even exist? If they did, I have yet to meet anyone from such a place in person - or at least anyone whose story I would believe."
 VIETold.2027.a: "If such people existed, then they're absolutely barbaric! Degenerates, all of them!"

 VIETold.2029.desc: "A traveler is regaling me with a tale he heard when he was visiting a town along the Nile one day. "I was told that during Roman times, Egypt's governor sent a trusted friend and advisor as a diplomat to the southern lands of Ethiopia, but he got lost in the desert not too far from where I stayed. He finally found a large oasis, where people still behaved like the ancient Egyptians, building pyramids and worshipping ancient gods, and they had no knowledge of how the Nile had been conquered by first the Hellenes and then the Romans.""
 VIETold.2029.a: "That a community would keep alive such ancient customs!" 
 VIETold.2029.b: "I'm sure they were merely some troglodytic peasants."

 VIETold.2030.t: "The Fabled Eastern Islands"
 VIETold.2030.desc: ""Ah! Let me tell you a story," the merchant says, after we finish with business. Not one to anger my jolly guest, we sit down as we feast and he tells me what he heard when he visited China not too long ago. "I was told that if one sails east, beyond even the fabled isles of Cipangu, one would eventually reach a large island ruled by towering men who ride steeds of solid gold. These people of the Sun are most intelligent and mighty and ruled by an immortal dragon.""

 VIETold.2031.t: "Opposite Land"
 VIETold.2031.desc: "An acquaintance tells me that she heard if one digs underground deep enough, one will emerge in another world where there are people similar to ours. However, they are the opposite of us - their women are taller than their men, the men stay at home and manage domestic affairs while the women fight wars, and most scandalously, siblings can wed one another. Still, my acquaintance said she heard this land was mostly peaceful and prosperous."
 VIETold.2031.a: "Perhaps their strange ways are why they're prosperous and peaceful."
 VIETold.2031.b: "Really now! How could a society like that possibly exist?"
 VIETold.2031.c: "How exciting! My imagination is trying to envision such a place."
 VIETold.2032.t: "Tale of the Labyrinth"
 VIETold.2032.desc: "Someone tells me of a king in a faraway land who was cruel, yet fair in his dealings.\n\nOnce, he hired an engineer to create the largest labyrinth the world has ever known. Those guilty of the worst crimes were put in this maze of tunnels and hallways, which were filled with all manner of violent beasts, as well as dangerous booby traps that could kill a man instantly. Almost none escaped, but there were always a few who had the wits and tenacity - or perhaps the luck and blessings of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] - to find their way out, and the king granted freedom to these few for their impressive achievement."
 VIETold.2032.a: "Someone capable enough to escape deserves freedom, yes."
 VIETold.2032.b: "A strange ruler! Such unnecessary and outlandish methods."
 VIETold.2032.c: "I hoped his labyrinth had many of those monsters and death traps!"
 VIETold.2033.t: "Guardian of the Gate"
 VIETold.2033.desc: "I have heard rumors about a noble and valiant warrior woman in a distant land, who is immortal and stands guard over an ancient gate made of marble and obsidian. Those who best her in combat will be allowed into the gate, which is a portal to a heavenly paradise, a most peaceful and pastoral landscape one can live in with no worries nor fears.\n\nIf it did exist, could I go there?"
 VIETold.2033.a: "If only I could go to such a place, I'd be so happy."
 VIETold.2033.b: "I'm sure I could beat that woman and gain entry."

 VIETold.2034.t: "A Dream of Danger"
 VIETold.2034.desc: "I meet a local village elder, a wizened old man, who was a foolhardy adventurer in his youth. He once got lost in a great forest, and almost drowned in its swamps. Fortunately, he was rescued by a mysterious man, who was of tall and handsome appearance, and carried himself in a calm and kind yet melancholy, somber, regal manner. This man referred to himself only as a dreamer, and warned about the seductive dangers of excitement and risk.\n\nAfterwards, the old man never sought out reckless excitement again, and lived a stable, quiet, happy life back home."
 VIETold.2034.a: "Agreed! Only idiots blindly worship excitement and ambition."
 VIETold.2034.b: "I disagree. What's the point of living a boring life?"

 VIETold.2035.t: "The Immortal Horse"

 VIETold.2035.b: "A fanciful tale, nothing more."
 VIETold.2036.t: "Woman in White"
 VIETold.2036.desc: "I have a guard who once visited a distant village by a forest, said to be a gateway to the world beyond. While there, he went in the forest despite the locals' warning.\n\nIn the forest, he encountered a pale maiden wearing a white dress. Though she was charming and bashful, there was something off about her; the tone of her voice was odd, and her dress fluttered in the wind in a strange way. Frightened out of his wits, he fled immediately, knowing she must have been an evil spirit of some sort.\n\nAccording to locals from that area, not only are such sightings common in the forest, but many have also mysteriously died or disappeared there."
 VIETold.2036.a: "What a coward! She couldn't have been a spirit."
 VIETold.2036.b: "Frightening things lie beyond the fringes of civilization!"
 VIETold.2036.info: "#emphasis Historical Context:#! The lady or woman in white is a type of spirit who appears in various folklores and mythologies around the world since ancient times. Oftentimes, she is the ghost of who died in tragic circumstances - perhaps in childbirth, or after her lover died, and so on. Sometimes she is a vengeful spirit who lures and attacks innocents; other times, she punishes the wicked, like adulterers."
 VIETold.2037.t: "A Dream of a Protector"
 VIETold.2037.desc: "My new maid is a strange woman. Her father was a merchant, and she often accompanied him on his journeys as child.\n\nShe claims when she was little, on one such journey, she and her father visited a forested land when she got lost in the woods at night. She was frightened, of course, and thought she would die.\n\nA mysterious woman found her sobbing, and guided her back to the main road. The woman was of tall and beautiful appearance, and carried herself in a friendly and serene, yet melancholy, somber, queenly manner. She barely spoke and before she disappeared, merely said she was a dreamer.\n\nTo this day, my servant wonders who her mysterious savior was."
 VIETold.2037.a: "A strange encounter!"
 VIETold.2037.b: "Wait - you met the #EMP Dreamer#!, didn't you!?!?"
 VIETold.2038.t: "The Scholar's Tale"
 VIETold.2038.desc: "I am hosting a prominent local scholar. Contrary to my expectations of him being an awkward, doddering old man, he is a tall, handsome, and charismatic young man. I see my maids and some of the noblewomen gazing upon him with an amusing hunger in their eyes as he recounts his many adventures with his soothing, deep voice.\n\nIn one of his anecdotes, he recalls the time he came across a large lake in my realm. He once visited it, but almost drowned when he tried taking a swim. When he came to, he found himself on one of the lake's islands he never saw before. As he describes its geography, I do not recall the existence of such a lake on such an island either."
 VIETold.2038.a: "What happened next?"
 VIETold.2039.tooltip: "This is all very mysterious!"
 VIETold.2039.t: "The Scholar's Tale"
 VIETold.2039.desc: "The scholar circled the shore of the island and came across an old temple built by the ancients, yet still in good condition despite being abandoned. There, he quickly prayed to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]. Afterwards, to his surprise, he found a small boat near the temple which he used to leave the island.\n\nEvery time he returned to the lake, he could never find the island again. No one has heard of an island on that lake with its characteristics and geography, and it isn't mentioned in local legends, and his fellow scholars have not found a trace of it in historical records. However, we're all sure he isn't lying, as he is a respected scholar after all."
 VIETold.2039.a: "There must have been something strange afoot. Otherworldly beings?"
 VIETold.2039.b: "Perhaps the whole thing was a dream?"
 VIETold.2039.c: "Will I find the island one day? Who knows what secrets it holds!"
 VIETold.2040.t: "Isle of Colors"
 VIETold.2040.desc: "I appear to have interrupted a heated debate. A few of my courtiers and servants have been discussing rumors they heard about a distant land known as the Isle of Colors, where men and women are like us, except for one thing: their skin is an unnatural color. What my courtiers cannot seem to agree on, however, is what that skin color is. Perhaps I can provide my input on the matter?"
 VIETold.2040.a: "The Isle of Colors can't really exist - a tale that's made up, I truly insist!"
 VIETold.2040.b: "Their skin's true color is pink... at least, that is what I think."
 VIETold.2040.c: "I'd have to say surely dark blue is their skin's natural hue!"
 VIETold.2040.d: "I'd guess their skin is green, though this I have not seen."
 VIETold.2040.e: "I don't know the answer - this truth I can't infer."

 VIETold.2041.t: "Blood and Iron"
 VIETold.2041.desc: "In my dreams I find myself a soldier in a world torn asunder. Ash and smoke fill the skies as I stand in a muddy trench, wearing outlandishly shaped, long robes. I glance around and see other men dressed the same way, and conclude this is a uniform of some sort. Nearby, I hear loud noises, like as if thousands of buildings were collapsing, so I cover my ears and close my eyes."
 VIETold.2041.a: "It doesn't really help much, though."
 VIETold.2042.t: "No Man's Land"
 VIETold.2042.desc: "Fearfully, I glance over the trench and see nothing but black mud at first. On the ground from one end of the horizon to another are stone-cold corpses with open eyes and still-bleeding wounds. Suddenly, another loud crash, this one closer.\n\nAs men around me begin to shout words I don't know, I see other soldiers grasping their weapons, which are strange, hollowed spears with crooked handles. I do understand, despite my terrified state, that I am to go over the muddy trench I am currently in and charge at some enemy on the other side. I duly grasp my hollow spear and follow the others over the trench."
 VIETold.2042.a: "Wait, what was that? Ahhh!"
 VIETold.2043.t: "A World at War"
 VIETold.2043.desc: "I scream as I see metallic horses and birds the size of houses swoop around me, while loud explosions rock everywhere. Men fall down like paper burned by a never-ending inferno, from flying pebbles that tear them to pieces. Others are blown to pieces as thunder strikes seemingly arbitrary places on the ground.\n\nThis is the future of humanity, I realize: there is no future, no hope. This is the war to end all wars, that the world shall end in an apocalypse of fire and hatred.\n\nI wake up, sweating. Was that a vision of the future? Surely not. But if it was... how much longer until our descendants witness such horrors? A century from now? Two centuries? Ten?"
 VIETold.2043.a: "I lie back down and try to sleep, but can't."
 VIETold.2044.t: "From the Steppes"
 VIETold.2044.desc: "There have been many nomad empires, some quite large and some quite small. But today I have met an elderly wise woman and self-proclaimed seer who says we have yet to see the greatest of these empires. She says in the not too distant future, a great conqueror shall come from the steppes and destroy all the kingdoms and empires in his path, if not the entire world.\n\nHa! As if that'd happen."
 VIETold.2044.a: "Many nomad hordes come and go, what would make this one any different?"
 VIETold.2045.t: "Scourge of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]"
 VIETold.2045.desc: "This lord shall be born grasping a blood clot in his fist, the seer proclaims, and his mighty warriors shall pour forth from the steppes like water flows down a river and wash the world in blood and death.\n\nShe laughs at my doubt, and says in a chilling tone: "This man, this instrument of war, this instrument of the divine is not to be trifled with, for he is the very fist of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] to punish all for their wickedness. By his arrows, the Jade Dragon to the east shall perish. Under the hooves of his riders, the Rajas of India shall fall one by one. Against his dark armor, forged from the very sins of mankind, even the fearsome Sword of Islam and the Crusader Kings will do naught but a scratch to this bloodied messenger of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName].""
 VIETold.2045.a: "Ha! The Jade Dragon cannot possibly fall."
 VIETold.2045.b: "The Rajas of India can fight such a monster!"
 VIETold.2045.c: "He sounds scary, but the Sword of Islam is stronger."

 VIETold.2092.t: "Ambush!"
 VIETold.2092.desc: "I was traveling at night with a group of people. We were all in a hurry.\n\n"We must move with haste, or else they'll catch us!" someone said.\n\nSuddenly, there were screams and fire.\n\n"Ambush! Run for it!" someone shouts.\n\nToo late - the next thing I knew, I was hit with several arrows and began bleeding profusely and losing consciousness."
 VIETold.2092.a: "Then I woke up. What a nightmare!"
 VIETold.2093.t: "Never Trust A Bandit"
 VIETold.2093.desc: "Unsavory bandits blackmailed a orphaned, young nobleman into making a number of deals with them, which they of course reneged on. They decided they wanted to kill him and tried to storm his residence, but with luck and some quick thinking, the man managed to escape his enemies. Now he comes to me, begging for my protection."
 VIETold.2093.a: "I can afford to send some of my guards to take care of these criminals."
 VIETold.2093.b: "This is not my problem. Figure this out on your own!"

 VIETold.2094.t: "The Final Dream"
 VIETold.2094.desc: "Some have told me that the process of dying is like stepping into a strange but gentle dream. Is there any truth to this?"
 VIETold.2094.a: "Perhaps. But thinking about this is unhelpful while we're alive."
 VIETold.2094.b: "Life is but a dream as well, is it not?"
 VIETold.2094.c: "I won't know for sure until I begin the final journey myself."
 VIETold.2094.d: "[ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] scholars say that when one dies..."
 VIETold.2095.t: "Visit from an Old Friend"
 VIETold.2095.desc: "Ever since I was a child, there was one servant in our family I was always close to who was like a second parent to me. She passed away of old age a couple days ago, and I have been greatly affected by this, feeling drained and mentally exhausted, trying to process it. Strangely, last night, she visited me in a dream.\n\nI couldn't tell where we met exactly, but I recall there was some sort of brilliant light, and the feeling of a gentle breeze caressing my face. My servant said she had always loved me like her own child, but now she had to go. She embraced me, wished me the best, and said goodbye for one last time before her final journey. I felt much better after that dream."
 VIETold.2095.a: "Farewell... but will it be forever?"
 VIETold.2096.t: "Do Not Fear Death"
 VIETold.2096.desc: "My trusted servant is on his deathbed. His death will come as a blow to many of us, as we respected the old man for his patience, humility, and wisdom, which he tried his best to impart to us. I and others are by his bedside as his final hour draws near, and I ask him if he is afraid of the end.\n\n"End? No, the journey doesn't end here," he smiles gently. "Death is just another path, one that we all must take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass. And then you see it.... White shores... and beyond, a far green country under a swift sunrise."\n\nHe looks at me serenely, before closing his eyes. Several hours later, he passes away."
 VIETold.2096.a: "I stay by his bedside for some time, contemplating his words."
 VIETold.2097.t: "Not Yet"
 VIETold.2097.desc: "I walk through a vast expanse of green grass, covered above by a sky of pure, pale blue. I come to a river where I see many people. I recognize them all as people in my life who passed away, some many years ago, from relatives and friends to old servants.\n\nOne goes up to me and says in a calm but concerned tone, "Why are you here? You will join us on this journey one day, but it is not your time yet. But you can enjoy the sunshine and fresh air with us for a little longer.""
 VIETold.2097.a: "I wake up peacefully, after spending time relaxing in that strange dream world."
 VIETold.2098.t: "Solemn Clarity"
 VIETold.2098.desc: "While walking near my residence, I spotted something on the ground by a patch of grass. To my surprise, I found a rat lying on its side. I was not fearful of it, as I realized it was dying. Its eyes gazed at me with a look full of solemn clarity, in a way one did not expect from such a creature - almost as if it was telling me something. Then, it stopped moving, and passed away."
 VIETold.2098.a: "There was something profound about it. Life is full of wonders."
 VIETold.2098.b: "That was weird. But a rat's a rat. Well now! Back to my walk."
 VIETold.2098.c: "An extraordinary rat! I'll cover its body with leaves as a sign of respect."
 VIETold.2099.t: "Thank You"
 VIETold.2099.desc: "That night, I dreamt I was standing in front of an old woman I never met before. Despite her age, she carried herself with grace, and she curtsied me.\n\n"Thank you for your kind gesture earlier today," she said. "Most would have ignored me as I lay dying. Whatever your intentions, your noble deed brings me peace in the afterlife, and I can move on."\n\nWhen I woke up, I was confused."
 VIETold.2099.a: "There was no way... could that have been?"
 VIETold.2100.t: "End of Life Rally"
 VIETold.2100.desc: "An acquaintance of mine was on his deathbed, unconscious and unresponsive for days. His family had gathered around him to pray and prepare his soul for the afterlife, when all of a sudden, he sat up, alert and sharp. His family was relieved and tried to talk to him, thinking he had recovered somehow, yet he just kept asking for me to come visit.\n\nI hastened to come to his bedside to witness this miracle."
 VIETold.2100.a: "I wonder why he wanted to see me?"
 VIETold.2101.t: "End of Life Rally"
 VIETold.2101.desc: "When I arrived at his house and entered his bedroom, he clapped with joy, and beckoned me to sit next to him. He inquired about various matters of state and provided me advice, claiming it was given to him by the wise spirits of the deceased. We humored him for an hour or so, until he said he was tired, and bid all farewell. The moment he closed his eyes, he passed away."
 VIETold.2101.a: "Strangely, his advice turned out to be actually very helpful."
 VIETold.2102.t: "A Night Visit?"
 VIETold.2102.desc: "I am pouring over a document at my desk at night when I see an adorable little girl scurrying back and forth in my room. Upon seeing each other, we both stare in confusion, so I ask her who she is and why she's here. "I'm cold and hungry," she mumbles shyly. Feeling sorry for her, I point to some food I had left on my table, and tell her to eat some."
 VIETold.2102.a: ""Thank you, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]," she squeaks, before  eating."
 VIETold.2103.t: "A Night Visit?"
 VIETold.2103.desc: "I suddenly wake up, realizing I must have dozed off while reading, and that the little girl must have been from a dream I had. I go to finish the rest of my food, but contrary to what I remember, none of my meal is left, save for a few crumbs.\n\nThe next morning, when I ask about her, I learned her appearance matched one of my guard's daughters, who passed away from illness a few days ago. The guard, a devout [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] believer, tells me he is certain I helped his child's soul pass into the afterlife, and thanks me."
 VIETold.2103.a: "She was a polite, kind child. She is surely now at peace in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DivineRealm]."
 VIETold.2103.b: "It must be a coincidence, but if thinking that way makes you feel better."
 VIETold.2104.t: "Unexpected Visitors"
 VIETold.2104.desc: "A trusted guard recently got injured, and while it thankfully isn't too painful, it's clear that it doesn't bode well for his health as he is now bedridden for much of the day. He is old and about to retire, anyways. One morning, I pay a visit when he tells me his grandparents stopped by just before I did. I point out that they died decades ago, but he assures me they did visit."
 VIETold.2104.a: "Are you really sure? Maybe you are imagining things."
 VIETold.2104.b: "Really! A truly marvelous thing. I hope they mean well."
 VIETold.2104.c: "Perhaps they did come. The universe is full of mysteries."
 VIETold.2105.t: "Passing On"
 VIETold.2105.desc: "I receive word that my trusted guard who recently got injured and was on his deathbed just passed away. Strangely, the day before that, his relatives said he told them that his grandparents came to help him pack for a journey. Could that have been a sign of things to come? Strange things have always preceded death, after all, as the stories tell."
 VIETold.2105.a: "He will be missed."
 VIETold.2106.t: "Indignity in Death"
 VIETold.2106.desc: "On an official trip, I am passing by one of the villages of my realm. As I leave the borders of the village, I see something odd by a bush and, together with my entourage, go to investigate. To my shock, it is the corpse of a haggard-looking old man in rags. I demand an explanation from the villagers, who say he was the local town beggar who just passed away."
 VIETold.2106.a: "I see. Very well, it is none of my concern - carry on."
 VIETold.2106.b: "Please dispose of the corpse, will you? It's unclean."
 VIETold.2106.c: "Beggar or not, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity!"
 VIETold.2106.tooltip: "You make the villagers give the man a proper funeral. Yet instead of being angry, the villagers are moved by your attitude, and admit they should have acted with more cmopassion like you."
 VIETold.2107.t: "What Kind Of Death?"
 VIETold.2107.desc: "There are those who argue a quick death is better, for it will be less painful and you won't have as much to worry and ruminate over. Others believe a slow and gradual death is preferable, for it gives one time to let go of regrets, pray, and make peace with one's family, friends, and [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]."
 VIETold.2107.a: "I prefer a quick death - things are simpler that way."
 VIETold.2107.b: "It's better if one has time to prepare before passing on."
 VIETold.2108.t: "Grave Robbers"
 VIETold.2108.desc: "Several hooligans were recently caught trying to raid a cemetery not too far from where I live, and they were apprehended by the local watchmen. This, of course, is absolutely forbidden out of respect for the spirits of the dead, and it is now up to me to determine the fate of these men."
 VIETold.2108.a: "Release the desperate, poor men. They've learned their lesson."
 VIETold.2108.b: "To think they wanted to desecrate the dead! Toss them in prison."
 VIETold.2109.t: "Late Night Visitor"
 VIETold.2109.desc: "Last night, I was in bed when I heard a noise. Alarmed, I sat up, and saw a young man pacing to and fro, as if busy with some matter. He apologized to me for the disturbance, and sheepishly said, "I apologize, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]. I need to take care of business in the underworld and accidentally stumbled here."\n\nWe exchanged small talk before he left. The next morning, when I asked the people of my household about it, no one reported ever seeing such a man. It is most bizarre!"
 VIETold.2109.a: "Maybe it was just a dream, yet it did not feel like a dream...."
 VIETold.2110.t: "The Myling"
 VIETold.2110.desc.religion: "[scope_VIET_myling_courtier.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')] claimed that last night, [scope_VIET_myling_courtier.GetSheHe] came across a Myling - the ghost of a dead child who had been wrongly killed by its parents.

 VIETold.2111.t: "Roadside Funeral"
 VIETold.2111.desc: "On the road, my entourage and I come across a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] in robes. He is kneeling on the ground, looking at nowhere in particular, as he chants some prayers.\n\nAfter he finishes, I ask him what he was doing. He explains that recently, a woman died here in an accident. She was a poor woman with no family, so out of compassion and pity, he gave her a modest but dignified funeral. He hopes her spirit will find peace with [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective]."

 VIETold.2111.b: "I understand. Carry on, then. We shan't bother you."
 VIETold.2111.c: "How noble! May we join you in praying for her spirit?"
 VIETold.2112.t: "Limits of Patience"
 VIETold.2112.desc: "I heard of a most amusing yet strange incident that happened recently! I know of this noblewoman in my realm who is quite annoying. She's not a bad person, but she's unbelievably chatty and intensely emotional, and if crossed can be quite a nag. Though middle aged, she died a few weeks ago... only to come back to life a few hours later. She said that apparently Death came to take her to the afterlife, but was so fed up with her company that he hurried to take her back home so he could come get her later. She's still healthy today."
 VIETold.2112.a: "Ha ha! I do feel sorry for old Death."
 VIETold.2112.b: "She was seeing things at the time, but that's funny."
 VIETold.2113.t: ""I Am Death""
 VIETold.2113.desc: "I rest in bed one evening when I hear a knock on the door. Thinking it is one of my servants, I beckon them in, only to see a pleasant young woman I do not recognize. Suddenly, there is a chill in the air, and the candles flicker out. The stranger looks at me with her dark eyes, and I hold my breath in anticipation.\n\n"I am Death," she says in a low, yet soothing whisper. "It's time for...""
 VIETold.2113.a: "Wait... what's going on? Is it... is it time for me to go?"
 VIETold.2114.t: "Common Mistake"
 VIETold.2114.desc: "Surprisingly, I am calm as I wait for her to finish - if it is my time to go, there isn't much I can do. But she stops herself and looks around, as if she just realized where she is.\n\nSuddenly, the candles are alight once more, and she bows to me. I look at her in bewilderment as she says, "I'm so sorry! You're the wrong person... I knew I got lost somehow. Dammit... why does this happen to me? I'm so unprofessional. Oh! My sincere apologies, I know this is such an inconvenience to you. And... um, by the way, I know I'm not in any position to ask, but do you by any chance know the way to...""

 VIETold.2114.tooltip: "To be fair to her, it is confusing if you've never been there before, so I kindly provide her some directions to where she wanted to go to. I reassure her, when she looks embarrassed, "It's a common mistake everyone makes. The roads in that part can be disorienting!""
 VIETold.2115.t: "Good Directions"
 VIETold.2115.desc: ""Thank you so much!" the maiden says cheerfully, with a beaming smile before she leaves. "I'll be back later, but not today. I wish you nothing but luck and fortune, [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')]!"\n\nThe next morning, no one knows who I'm talking about when I ask if they saw a girl with the same description as that maiden. I chalk up the whole incident to be a dream my sleep-deprived mind concocted, until I receive news later that afternoon that an acquaintance of mine died last night.\n\nHe happened to live in that village the maiden asked directions to."
 VIETold.2115.a: "That silly, absentminded girl who visited me was... Death?"
 VIETold.2115.b: "No, no.... I'm sure it's a coincidence and was just a dream."
 VIETold.2116.t: "Annoying Ghosts"
 VIETold.2116.desc: "A wandering holy man is stopping by our court today, and telling us stories of the various phenomena he has encountered, as he is sometimes called on by people to resolve supernatural problems. For instance, recently, as he passed by a village in my domain, he had to exorcise a mischievous ghost who made loud noises and threw around objects in a peasant's house."
 VIETold.2116.a: "Fascinating! Some spirits are just as troublesome as the living."
 VIETold.2116.b: "I am not sure whether I find such a story believable."
 VIETold.2117.t: "Living Undead"
 VIETold.2117.desc: "Commoners have always told tales about corpses rising from the dead if their funerals were not performed properly, or if they died in unjust ways. Lately I hear more and more rumors about such occurrences in the region, but the scholars and [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] assure me such things are mere superstitions. No true believer of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] faith would ever believe in such drivel!"

 VIETold.2118.t: "Generations"
 VIETold.2118.desc: "I was thinking today about all the people who have come and go since the beginning of time.... It is interesting, if somber, to imagine what they would think of us, their descendants, and whether they would be proud or disappointed in us."

 VIETold.2120.desc: "I'm paying a visit to an acquaintance of mine, who nearly died in an accident when she was a young woman, and was in fact unconscious for a week after it before she slowly recovered. She said that during that week, she actually had a glimpse of the afterlife, and she said it looked like a simple yet beautiful garden filled with light. The experience moved her greatly."

 VIETold.2123.t: "Aftermath"
 VIETold.2123.desc: "I am traveling in a less populated and more rugged part of my realm, and my entourage and I come across a number of corpses, and the stench of decaying flesh is noticeable to everyone. Judging by the armor and clothing on the bodies, as well as the wounds on them, it seems that this may have been the scene of a recent battle between rival bandit gangs that infest this region."
 VIETold.2123.a: "These lowly people deserve to be food for vultures and crows."
 VIETold.2123.b: "Let's properly dispose of these bodies, lest they rise as vengeful spirits!"
 VIETold.2123.c: "Bandits or not, we should give them a funeral, to put their souls at ease."
 VIETold.2124.t: "A Friendly Stalker"
 VIETold.2124.desc: "I was making my way through a local town market when I felt something was watching me. I looked around and saw nothing, yet could not shake off the feeling. My concerned guards thought maybe I sensed an assassin. A passing [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] noticed my anxiety, and told me cryptically: "Ah, a ghost seems attached to you. Don't worry - it's a gentle spirit who means no harm, and is curious and playful more than anything. It might even help you out, and will leave you alone once its curiosity has been sated.""

 VIETold.2125.t: "A Necrophiliac?"
 VIETold.2125.desc: "A local townsman is accused of abominable crimes! Known for his insatiable lust, he frequents houses of ill repute and tries to seduce any woman, from innocent virgins to old widows. That would have been fine, if inproper, but his true crimes - if they are to be believed - are worse. They say he went to graveyards at night to fornicate with the lonely female ghosts, or so his accusers claim to have witnessed. Others argue that despite his vices, there is no sound evidence of this and that these may be false accusations made up by his many enemies, whether they are jilted former lovers to jealous husbands he cuckholded."
 VIETold.2125.a: "Clearly baseless stories made up by his enemies. Ignore the matter."
 VIETold.2125.b: "This man is a necrophiliac! He must be executed immediately!"
