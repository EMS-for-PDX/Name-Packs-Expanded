 khuzestan.0053.desc: "I’ve recently traveled to my territories in [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_khuzestan_region').GetName] to better understand the local issues there. One thing I noted were the great engineering structures, many built long ago by the ancient Persians, that seemed to dot the landscape as it were.\n\nEver since I’ve returned home, these brilliant construction feats have been on my mind. To think that the ancients were capable of such wonders!\n\nIt has occurred to me that perhaps I should send some engineers and scholars to study these structures. That way, we can apply the engineering methods the ancients used to help us in various building projects we have around the realm."
 khuzestan.0053.a: "A good idea! Let’s do that."
 khuzestan.0053.b: "I should focus on other issues."
