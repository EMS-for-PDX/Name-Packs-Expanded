 VIETtrinity.0001.desc: "Lately, a number of [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] have communicated to me their reservations about various translations of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.ReligiousText] into their local, vernacular languages. It can be difficult, I know. On one hand, we want to preach [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] teachings to as many  as we can. On the other hand, it is easy to distort the word of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] and insert heretical ideas - wittingly or not - when the translation is sloppy\n\n Anyways, I’ve decided to write a few letters to some of these more prominent [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] to help guide them with these problems. What should I tell them? What should I say to encourage them, as their [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')], so that they know how to tell if a translation is good?"

 VIETtrinity.0002.desc: "[relative.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has approached me requesting for some… “blessings,” as [relative.GetSheHe] calls it. Of course, I understand entirely what [reltaive.GetSheHe] #italic really#! means.\n\n As the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')], I can help [relative.GetHerHim] grease some wheels, since [relative.GetSheHe] is related to me, after all. This is not a bribe, of course - [relative.GetSheHe] wouldn’t dare be brazen enough to request me to explicitly do a favor for [relative.GetHerHim]. Simply, [relative.GetSheHe] just wants me to help [relative.GetHerHim] deal with any troublesome local [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] and to look better in everyone’s eyes by communicating to others about what a good [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentName] I am. After all, aren’t we family?"

 VIETtrinity.0003.desc: "Sometimes, I feel my responsibilities as a [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')] are simply so immense. Too immense, even. I must lead every [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentName] in the world, and guide them towards the wisdom and love of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]. Am I truly worthy of such a thing? The expectations weigh on me deeply, and lately, I have just been feeling overwhelmed."

 VIETtrinity.0005.desc: "Today, I have the opportunity to choose a legate to represent me, the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')], in a faraway land. I am mulling over some of the potential candidates, and they all have their good points and bad points and how they can further the glory of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] faith. Which one do I think will do a good job representing our interests and the will of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]?"

 VIETtrinity.0006.desc: "Every now and then, I hear about how some secular rulers are resentful of the power I wield as a [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')].\n\nSuch sentiments are ironic, of course. I do not think I have much temporal power; there are warlords with plenty of lands and wealth, yet they clearly envy the spiritual influence I possess over many [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentNamePlural]. Some of them see me as nothing more than another petty monarch or warlord with rival interests, and even then I sometimes hear others claiming that I and those who work under me have no business worrying about administrative matters.\n\nAnyways, hearing about all this troubles me."

 VIETtrinity.0007.desc: "A number of officials that have come to work under me in my capacity as the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')] have been praised for both their adherence to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] doctrine, and their abilities to administer well. Justified or not, many claim it is thanks to my inspiring, virtuous, pious leadership that follows and honors [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] teachings."

 VIETtrinity.0008.desc: "I received a tempestuous letter from a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] scholar today, and my staff urged me to read it because they thought it presented some interesting ideas.Though the tone of the letter was formal and proper, it was also fiery and passionate as well.\n\nIn the letter, this scholar spoke about the apocalypse, and how we could better predict when it could come based on various studies of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] scriptures, and mathematical calculations from astrological science.\n\n“[ROOT.Char.Custom('TitledFirstName')], if we are to protect the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] faithful against the end of days, we must study sacred texts, prophecies, and natural philosophy,” the letter urged me. “If we have a better idea of when the apocalypse is coming, we can do a lot to fight against the evils that will be perpetuated by the agents of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName].”"

 VIETtrinity.0014.desc: "I have lately heard gossip from many quarters about how I have been living a life most unfit for a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')], one full of opulence and luxury. One can only wonder how such rumors started, but some have suggested I need to cut back on various frivolous expenses and trinkets, as it were."
