 siberia.0001.desc.evenk: "The Evenks are a group of many different tribes who dwell between Lake Baikal and the Amur River, a mixture of pastoralists and hunter-gatherers. While many Siberian peoples have domesticated reindeer, none have done as well as the Evenks in this regard."
 siberia.0001.desc.nivkh: "The Nivkh are a band of tribes who live along the coasts of Manchuria and Sakhalin. A mostly peaceful and hospitable peoples, they occasionally pay tribute to their more powerful, southern neighbors, but otherwise keep mostly to themselves."
 siberia.0001.desc.yakut: "The Yakuts are Turkic pastoralist tribes, who, unlike their other Turkic cousins, migrated northwards into Siberia over the centuries. While they retain their ancestral wisdom from the warmer south, they have also learned to master the skills needed to thrive in the frozen north."
 siberia.0001.desc.yeniseian: "The Yeniseians, who mainly dwell along the Yenisei river, have survived in the harsh conditions of Siberia for generations. From time to time the Yeniseian tribes have been involved in the affairs of their more southern nomadic neighbors."
 siberia.0001.desc.yukaghir: "The Yukaghirs are the ancient tribes of northern Siberia, who once dwelled as far south as Lake Baikal, but have for centuries been pushed ever more eastwards and northwards by other peoples. They live a nomadic life, roaming the inhospitable sub-arctic and arctic regions for food and shelter."
 siberia.0001.a: "[scope_RICE_siberian.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is welcome to stay at our court!"

 siberia.0003.desc.hunting: "track, capture, and kill animals in the freezing wilds of Siberia. While these methods are chiefly involved in the process of hunting, they also have a number of other applications, such as tracking enemy troops in the wilderness, or being able to survive alone in the wild if need be."
 siberia.0003.desc.gathering: "gather and forage for food and basic necessities in the unforgiving cold terrain of Siberia. Knowing which berries or mushrooms are edible and not poisonous, being able to identify sources of water and shelter - these are important skills that could save one’s life."
 siberia.0003.desc.music: "commune with the spirit world and gain a greater understanding of the cosmos and the world through music and song. The legends and lore of the Siberian north can teach one a lot about the nature of the land and the societies of this vast region."
 siberia.0003.desc.evenk: "breed their reindeer herds. The Evenki mastery of reindeer domestication exceeds that of other peoples of the far north, and this information is useful for not only maintaining one’s reindeer herds in general, but also in other matters such as land use and the rearing of other animals."
 siberia.0003.desc.nivkh: "catch and cook fish from the cold rivers and coasts of Siberia. Fish are a mainstay of the Nivkh diet, and the Nivkh, renowned for their hospitality, often provide others - even strangers - with large helpings of fish. These lessons are thus not only about fishing and food, but generosity to one’s fellows as well."
 siberia.0003.desc.yakut: "raise animals such as horses, cattle, and dogs in the arctic regions. The Yakuts originally migrated northwards from more temperate, southern regions; as they moved northwards, they developed clever strategies to breed the animals they had domesticated to withstand the colder climate."
 siberia.0003.desc.yeniseian: "retell and pass on the ancient stories of the Yeniseian peoples. As some of the oldest tribes inhabiting the Siberian region, the Yeniseians have, for centuries, understood themselves and the universe through shamanic folklore and practices."
 siberia.0003.desc.yukaghir: "roam the land in search of food, shelter, and resources. A nomad does not wander randomly: the Yukaghirs have lived as nomads in the cold forests and tundras of the north for generations, and they have mastered the techniques needed to know where to go and when to do it."

 siberia.0020.t: "Preparing for the Reindeer Sacrifice"
 siberia.0020.desc: "I have decided to sacrifice a number of reindeer in order to appease the local spirits. Hopefully, doing so will bring happiness and prosperity to my family and my people. However, such a ceremony cannot be done on a whim, and will require some planning first.\n\nAfter consulting with several shamans, we have decided on a good day for the sacrifice. Though this is a small, communal event, I need to notify several prominent families in the area about it, and traditionally there have been two ways of doing so - either through a stick with notches, or a string with knots."
 siberia.0020.a: "Each notch denotes the number of days until the sacrifice."
 siberia.0020.b: "Invitees untie one knot each day to count down till the sacrifice."
 siberia.0021.t: "Where?"
 siberia.0021.desc: "As part of the planning process for the reindeer sacrifice, a kind of shaman known as the chirta-ko needs to seek a choice of location. The chirta-ko I have brought on tells me an auspicious location for the sacrifice was revealed in his dream."
 siberia.0021.a: "I inspect the site in the wilderness, and find it promising."
 siberia.0022.t: "Before the Reindeer Sacrifice"
 siberia.0022.desc: "The time for the reindeer sacrifice is soon upon us. I myself, along with my family, courtiers, and a few prominent local families, have arrived at the makeshift encampment where we will later sacrifice the reindeer. While the days-long ceremony won’t begin until nighttime, it is traditional for people to engage in all manner of socialization or friendly contests and games while waiting. Perhaps I, too, should participate."
 siberia.0022.a: "Help attend to the little children playing around."
 siberia.0022.b: "Compete in contests of strength, agility, and cunning."
 siberia.0022.c: "Admire the scenery and nature all around me."
 siberia.0023.t: "Divination Rites"
 siberia.0023.desc: "Night falls, and it is time for the preparatory rites. The first is a divination, which happens before we eat dinner. The chirta-ko sings and drums various songs to the spirits, which means it is time for all who are present to ask questions that might be answered later. As the most prominent person there, I am allowed to ask first. Once I and everyone asks our questions, the chirta-ko will consume a large number of mushrooms and go into a trance so that he can find the answers we seek."
 siberia.0023.a: "What should be done so the people and reindeer will be healthy?"
 siberia.0023.b: "What should be done so the realm will give us abundance?"
 siberia.0023.c: "What should be done so we can please the spirits of the land?"
 siberia.0024.t: "Chirta-Ko's Advice"
 siberia.0024.desc.start: "After the chirta-ko consumes the mushrooms, he sings and drums wildly, as if the spirits have entered his body and become one with him. We all watch, curiously, to see if anyone else will be affected by this - it is not unheard of for the trance to jump from the shaman to another person present."
 siberia.0024.desc.self: "\n\nTo my surprise, I begin to feel a stirring inside me, and brilliant, vivid images flash before my eyes - have I been chosen? Without knowing quite why, I begin tapping my head, signifying to the others that I am feeling strange. Someone hands a drum to me, and without being prompted, I beat it wildly as I start to sing along with the chirta-ko. Later, when I have calmed down and returned to the mundane realm, I realize that the spirits gave me an answer to my question directly."
 siberia.0024.desc.courtier: "\n\nSuddenly, [scope_RICE_siberia_reindeer_high_courtier.Custom('TitledFirstName')] taps [scope_RICE_siberia_reindeer_high_courtier.GetHerHis] head, signifying [scope_RICE_siberia_reindeer_high_courtier.GetSheHe] feels something coming from within [scope_RICE_siberia_reindeer_high_courtier.GetHerHim]. Immediately, [scope_RICE_siberia_reindeer_high_courtier.GetSheHe] is given a drum, and begins beating it wildly and singing along with the chirta-ko - even more loudly, in fact. Together, they sing the answer to my question as given by the spirits, and what I can do."
 siberia.0024.desc.none: "\n\nIn the end, it appears no one else went into a trance. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it is always interesting when it does happen. Regardless, the chirta-ko sings the answer to my question as given by the spirits, and what I can do."
 siberia.0024.a: "Hopefully the advice will be helpful!"
 siberia.0025.t: "Preparing the Altar"
 siberia.0025.desc: "Following the divination, dinner, and sleep, we all wake up early the next morning. Together with a number of reindeer, we all depart from the encampment and make our way to the site of the sacrifice.\n\nOnce we arrive at the altar, we lay several goods as offerings for Turum and the other gods and spirits, such as food, precious metals and gems, and various everyday items. Meanwhile, several men nearby kindle a fire.\n\nFinally, the reindeer who are to be sacrificed are brought before the altar. Each family participating in the sacrifice has provided at least one reindeer."
 siberia.0025.a: "I, of course, provided the most reindeer."
 siberia.0026.t: "The Reindeer Sacrifice"
 siberia.0026.desc: "The multeh-ko, a shaman who specializes in ritual matters, leads the group in prayers, occasionally punctuating the prayers with chants of “wo-wo-wo!” We also bow to the sun, while some assigned youths lasso the tops of nearby saplings to bring good luck.\n\nAt last, the reindeer are brought before the altar, and killed. Immediately afterwards, each reindeer is skinned and butchered. It is done swiftly, and everyone is careful not to spill any blood on the snow, as is tradition. We then offer the reindeer meat to the spirits."
 siberia.0026.a: "Surely the spirits will be pleased by this!"
 siberia.0027.t: "Pregnant Reindeer Sacrificed"
 siberia.0027.desc: "Great news! It appears one of the sacrificed reindeers was actually pregnant. This is a wonderful blessing, for in one swoop, we have sacrificed two reindeers and not just one. A few people are assigned to carefully bury the foetus some distance away."
 siberia.0027.a: "This is truly a wonderful blessing."
 siberia.0028.t: "Reindeer Feast"
 siberia.0028.desc: "Now that the sacrifice is done, we return to the encampment, and make a meal out of the reindeer meat and organs from the sacrifice. No part of the reindeer goes to waste, and everyone has a good time. Afterwards, we all say a prayer of thanksgiving. The chirta-ko returns with a red cloth which he uses to touch the forehead of every person present. Once he is done with that, he prays to the spirits, and throws the cloth into the fire."
 siberia.0028.a: "With that, the formal part of the sacrificial ritual is over."
 siberia.0029.t: "Reindeer Sacrifice Ends"
 siberia.0029.desc: "The next day is devoted to cleaning up after the sacrifice. Some people are assigned to ritually dispose of the altar, while others hang the skins of the sacrificed reindeer from trees as a final offering to the spirits. Finally, we all gather at night for one last time, as the chirta-ko goes into a trance once more to communicate with the gods and spirits, informing them of our sacrifice and asking them to accept it."
 siberia.0029.a: "And with that, the reindeer sacrifice ends." 
 siberia.0040.t: "Tusked Beast's Remains"
 siberia.0040.desc: "Hunters in the area have recently discovered the remains of a tusked gargantuan creature. Siberian peoples have traditionally believed these to be the corpses of giant, mole-like animals that died while trying to burrow to the surface, while others from outside lands sometimes believe these to be the corpses of primordial giant beasts. Either way, as the remains were found within my jurisdiction, it is up to me to decide what should be done with them, particularly the tusks, which are lucrative."
 siberia.0040.a: "Sell the tusks to any merchants who are passing by."
 siberia.0040.b: "Sell the tusks to merchants and make sure to get a good profit."
 siberia.0040.c: "Keep the tusks to use in our traditional artwork."
 siberia.0040.d: "Perhaps the tusks can be used to carve a throne for me?"
 siberia.0040.e: "Could we try to eat the meat? I wonder what it tastes like."

We have no idea when this burial site was built, and no one recognizes the art style used to decorate the tomb or the various items within it. The [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] say it is fortunate that grave robbers have not emptied out the area, and that I should honor the dead spirits with [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] rites and otherwise not disturb them."

 siberia.0042.t: "Bear Attack"
 siberia.0042.desc: "Though brown bears tend to avoid coming into conflicts with humans, attacks are not unheard of in the Siberian region. Unfortunately, one such attack recently occurred close to where I live, killing a few locals in the process."

 siberia.0043.t: "Kolonok Furs"
 siberia.0043.desc: "Kolonoks are a type of weasel that inhabit Siberia, and some local hunters have brought me their kolonok furs they recently hunted. Though considered lower quality than the furs of more valued species of animals, they are still considered desirable, and sometimes intentionally used as substitutive imitations of furs from other species. Catching and killing the kolonoks is always an arduous process, as once caught intraps, the beasts often emit loud shrieks that can drive anyone mad and secrete an odor so pungent that it takes weeks to go away. Thus, the hunters have gone through a lot of effort to bring these my way."
 siberia.0043.a: "Thank you for your gifts. I will make good use of them."
 siberia.0043.b: "Perhaps we can sell these furs for a nice profit."

 siberia.0044.t: "Antler Mound"
 siberia.0044.desc: "While out in the wilderness today, I came across what seemed like the remains of antlers atop a small mound, no taller than a child. I quickly realized that this must have been where someone was buried, as it is ancient tradition in these parts to put reindeer antlers on top of the place where someone was buried. I look around, and don’t see any reindeer skins or hooves hanging from the trees, another traditional funerary practice in these parts. Because of this, I conclude whoever was buried here must have passed away a long time ago."
 siberia.0044.a: "Say a few prayers for whoever is buried here."
 siberia.0044.b: "Reflect somberly on those who came before us."
 siberia.0045.t: "Frozen Dumplings"
 siberia.0045.desc: "I was out traveling today in the cold wilderness of my realm. While me and my companions rest for lunch, we take out our bags of dumplings, filled with minced meat and mushrooms. These dumplings are traditionally left outside to freeze, preserving them and making them a great supply to take along on longer trips in the colder regions of the Siberian taiga. At any rate, we put the dumplings in a pot of boiling water, and wait until they are finished cooking."
 siberia.0045.a: "A delicious meal, despite its simplicity."
 siberia.0046.t: "Shaved Fish"
 siberia.0046.desc: "Today I have some guests over, and we are eating shaved fish - a dish traditionally popular in Siberia. It is made by freezing fish and ‘shaving’ the fish into thin strips of meat. This is then eaten fresh and raw, with a little bit of salt and pepper if available."

 siberia.0047.t: "Reindeer Stones"
 siberia.0047.desc: "Locals have recently located another reindeer stone in my territories in Siberia. These are large granite or greenstone slabs, often facing the east, that have various images carved onto them, ranging from human faces to birds, tigers, and geometric patterns, but the most common are stylized depictions of reindeer. Many believe the stones were once used by those who once dwelt here many generations ago. At any rate, we could reuse these ancient sites if we wanted, even if the stones are too large to move usually."
 siberia.0047.a: "Leave the stones be - it’s best not to disturb the ancients."
 siberia.0047.b: "Use it for the burials of any prominent locals in the area."

 siberia.0049.desc: "In the Siberian regions, it is traditional for people to drink an herbal tea made from the fireweed plant. It is said to help strengthen one’s constitution and body. Lately, I have been drinking quite a bit of this fireweed tea."

 siberia.0051.b: "I would rather relax at home today."
