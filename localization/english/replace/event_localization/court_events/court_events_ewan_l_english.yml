 # PATRONAGE
 court.2001.t: "Competitive Cronying"
 court.2001.desc: "Neither [crony_a.Custom('FirstName')] nor [crony_b.Custom('FirstName')] notice as I creep closer to their boisterous hallway conversation.\n\n"#EMP Physical#! supplication is key! Every groveling-induced bruise on my knee is fresh coin in my purse! You just can't go wrong with prostration."\n\n"Nonsense, just keep stacking adjectives in front of [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] title and you'll be rich till you die. If you've got air in your lungs before you get to '[ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')]', you're doing it wrong."\n\nI cough, hushing the mortified toadies instantly."
 court.2001.a: "Honestly, you could both try harder at this."
 court.2001.a.sadistic: "Whoever bows lowest gets this #EMP shiny#! coin. Go."
 court.2001.a.sadistic.crony_a_wins: "[crony_a.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] bows lowest"
 court.2001.a.sadistic.crony_b_wins: "[crony_b.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] bows lowest"
 court.2001.b: "I see right through your manipulations, lackeys!"
 court.2001.c: "I think you're missing the most obvious way to my heart..."
 court.2001.d: "This is beneath me."

 # MAJESTY
 court.2201.t: "A Slice of the Pie"
 court.2201.desc: ""-belongs to me! Dividing [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier] up between separate heirs makes no sense!" cries [eldest_heir.Custom('FirstName')] as [eldest_heir.GetSheHe] and [younger_heir.Custom2('HerHisCharacterIntroduction', eldest_heir)] bicker loudly at the other end of the room. "We're dooming the realm to murder and civil war. [ROOT.Char.GetMotherFather|U] should leave all [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] lands to #EMP me#!!"\n\n"Murder? Civil war? Exactly #EMP what#! do you have planned for when you're [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')]?" snorts [younger_heir.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]. "You'll be an utter monster of a ruler if this is how you think about your own [younger_heir.Custom('SisterBrother')] before the crown has even #EMP touched#! your ugly skull."\n\nMy head throbs. They've been arguing. All. Morning."
 court.2201.a: "Entitled to #EMP more#!, [eldest_heir.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]? How about #EMP nothing#!!"
 court.2201.b: "Sad to say, those are just the rules of the game, [younger_heir.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]..."
 court.2201.c: "They're siblings, they'll get along #EMP fine#! without me, right?"
 court.2201.d: "Children, do you want to know the real meaning of family?"

 # FOREIGN GUESTS
 court.2401.t: "Second-Hand Glamor"
 court.2401.desc: ""Finest raiments in the land, [buyer.Custom('FirstName')], mostly because they #EMP ain't#! from this land", chortles [seller.Custom('FirstName')] as I walk past [seller.GetHerHis] open chamber. [seller.GetHerHis|U] voice oozes charm, but even so, my other courtier seems unsure of the pitch.\n\n"Almost new, just as good as new, and fresh from the trend-setters in [grander_ruler.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] court! These are what #EMP everyone#! in the [grander_ruler.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName] will be wearing next season."\n\n"
 court.2401.a: "My, those #EMP do#! look enticing..."
 court.2401.b: "We don't need foreign nonsense in my court!"
 court.2401.c: "Who cares what people wear?"

 court.2411.t: "Labyrinthine Halls"
 court.2411.desc: "My stroll takes me through a disused wing of the palace, touring some capacious (if dusty) quarters that my over-worked staff seldom visit, when I hear a phlegmy sobbing coming from a by-passage.\n\nInvestigating, I find [lost_guest.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)], collapsed in despair. [lost_guest.GetSheHe|U] surges up the second [lost_guest.GetSheHe] sees me, grabbing me by the shoulders, and starts babbling like a mad[lost_guest.GetWomanMan].\n\n"[ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')], I've been lost in these passages for #EMP three days#!! I can't find the way out, just endless loops of connecting corridors and mouldering chambers with nary a servant in sight!""
 court.2411.a: "By [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], let me show you the way out!"
 court.2411.b: "How in the... How #EMP foolish#! can you possibly be?"
 court.2411.c: "*Whistling* What a honeycomb of halls I keep..."
