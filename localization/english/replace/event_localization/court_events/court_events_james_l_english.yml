 court.0101.desc.sumptuary:0 "violating the sumptuary law of [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')].\n\n [lowborn_criminal.GetSheHe] has been wearing all sorts of gaudy and unsightly fabrics and mismatched clothing. This is more than a mere crime against [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')], this is a crime against common decency."

 court.0107.t: "[unruly_child.Custom('RegNameNoTooltip')] in Despair"
 court.0107.desc: "From my throne, I hear the visceral cries of [unruly_child.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] and the sounds of a struggle. Promptly bolting up and racing down the hallway, I skid to a stop when I see [tutor.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] restraining the poor [unruly_child.Custom('GetLassLad')] with one arm and awkwardly clutching a book with the other.\n\nI barely have time to bark a demand for explanation when both begin blurting out their version of events.\n\n"[unruly_child.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')] refuses to allow me to read [unruly_child.GetHerHim] my masterpiece on the art of [tutor.Custom('GetTutorEducation')]!" cries the tutor.\n\n"I've heard this dreary book a thousand times!" [unruly_child.Custom('RegNameNoTooltip')] protests. "It's so #EMP boring!#!""
 court.0107.a: "[unruly_child.Custom('RegNameNoTooltip')], trust that [tutor.Custom('RegNameNoTooltip')] knows best."

 court.0108.a: "Don’t be a killjoy, [sceptical_courtier.Custom('RegNameNoTooltip')]. They shall marry in the morning!"
 court.0108.b: "[sceptical_courtier.Custom('RegNameNoTooltip')] is right! To the dungeon with [foreign_prince.GetHerHim]!"
 court.0108.c: "Thank you for the visit, [foreign_prince.Custom('GetPrincessPrince')] [foreign_prince.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')], but you should leave."

 court.0109.desc: "As I wander around my court, I hear the familiar mutterings of my courtiers making merry and debating their role in [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTooltip]. To my surprise, however, I hear [executioner.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)], making conversation with [learned_courtier.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] about the nature of healing and medicine. [executioner.GetSheHe|U] seems remarkably familiar with the workings of the human body, and upon noticing my approach, [executioner.GetSheHe] turns to me and invites me to join the conversation.\n\n"You don't spend all your days cutting men open without learning a thing or two about the workings of [executioner.GetFaith.HighGodNamePossessive] own creation." [executioner.GetSheHe|U] says after describing [executioner.GetHerHis] method of using leeches to purge corruption from an infected wound.\n\nIt would seem [executioner.Custom('RegNameNoTooltip')] has been using [executioner.GetHerHis] expertise in human anatomy to help the locals of [ROOT.Char.GetCapitalLocation.GetTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] and has become a bit of a local healer and midwife. [executioner.GetSheHe|U] has also confessed to providing medical care to the lowlifes in my dungeon."

 court.0110.desc.outro:0 "My [parent.GetMotherFather] chastises me with little remorse.\n\n"Every night you busy yourself enjoying these earthly delights, you are drawing one step closer to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.NegativeAfterLife]!" [chaplain.Custom('RegNameNoTooltip')] adds. "We confront you now to save your soul, dear child. A vow of celibacy is required, only this and nothing less may save your soul from an eternity of torment.""

 court.0111.desc: "As I wander the court, I find myself running into a heated discussion between [executioner.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] and [antiquarian.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] over whether or not the skull of [rival.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] would make for a fitting artifact for my court.\n\n"Ah, m'[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], I was wantin' to be give'n you the skull of [rival.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')] as a gift, should [rival.GetSheHe] meet an untimely demise." [executioner.GetName] rubs [executioner.GetHerHis] blood-smattered hands together with a childlike glee. "Or perhaps fashion [rival.GetHerHis] teeth together into a stylish necklace!"\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord] surely you do not intend for me to attempt to disguise such a morbid object as a relic befitting the court!" [antiquarian.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')] protests. "Perhaps this creature should remain in the dungeons where [executioner.GetSheHe] belongs, and leave the matter of relics and antiques to the experts.""

 court.0112.desc: "I find myself venturing deep into my illustrious wardrobe, hungry for what magnificent fabrics lie closer to the back. I find a tartan bag, far heavier than any others, and upon slicing it open, fall backwards on myself as the potent stench of a rotting corpse flares at my nostrils.\n\nThe body of a stranger, partially decomposed, mummified, and sitting in a pool of [corpse.GetHerHis] own juices, yawns slowly out at me.\n\nI shriek like a babe, and as if summoned by my call, [guilty_courtier.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] appears in the doorway, a knowing look of guilt and revulsion writ across [guilty_courtier.GetHerHis] face.\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord] you must believe me when I say was defending myself! [corpse.GetSheHe|U] broke into your chambers and had I not acted, [corpse.GetName] would have killed me or [guilty_courtier.GetFaith.HighGodName] only knows what else!"\n\n[guilty_courtier.Custom('RegNameNoTooltip')] is so clearly wrought with grief that [guilty_courtier.GetSheHe] confessed immediately to me without confrontation. "I beg of you, look the other way and I will fashion you a garment that will make even the richest [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')] turn green!""
