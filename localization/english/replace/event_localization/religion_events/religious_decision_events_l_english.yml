 religious_decision.0002.desc.start_no_offering: "[realm_priest.Custom('FirstName')] stares at me, perplexed. "You offer... yourself? I guess that works..." [realm_priest.GetSheHe] says, as [realm_priest.GetSheHe] starts walking around me in circles."

 religious_decision.0501.desc: "For generations, the nobility of the [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName] have professed devotion to the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentNameNoTooltip] faith, but religious pluralism with local Gods has been commonplace within [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetAdjectiveNoTooltip] society.

 religious_decision.0502.desc.righteous: "In a royal decree, those still worshipping the old ways will no longer gain preferential treatment within the [khazar_khan.GetPrimaryTitle.GetTierAsNameNoTooltip], and all those who swear fealty to the [khazar_khan.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')] must also swear fealty to God himself."
 religious_decision.0502.desc.fundamentalist: "Not only is religious pluralism at an end, but any not practicing orthodox [khazar_khan.GetFaith.GetNameNoTooltip] are necessarily an enemy of the [khazar_khan.GetPrimaryTitle.GetTierAsNameNoTooltip].
