 ## Desperate faction vassals attempt a coup by Isabella Welch
 yearly.7001.t: "The Last Day"
 yearly.7001.desc: "My [marshal.GetCouncilTitle], [marshal.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')], hands me my favorite [ROOT.Char.Custom('signature_weapon')]. It is sharpened and polished, so I see a fraction of my own visage within it.\n\n"You should carry this for your own sake. Dissenters scurry through your court like diseased rats, and each time we attend a public function, I wonder if it is our last."\n\n[marshal.GetSheHe|U] stares out of the window. "Perhaps we ought to increase the guard patrols... There is a sickly taste to this morning's air, and I am afraid.""
 yearly.7001.a: "It will unnerve the guests! This is mere paranoia."
 yearly.7001.b: "Add a few more patrols in for luck."
 yearly.7001.c: "Do you #EMP know#! something, [marshal.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')]?"
 yearly.7001.c.tt: "[marshal.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')] tells you more of [marshal.GetHerHis] suspicions"
 yearly.7001.tt: "[marshal.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')] brushes aside your questions"
 yearly.7001.d: "Pack the [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('FortifiedBuilding')] with guards. Let no room remain unwatched!"
 yearly.7001.d.tt: "You scare everyone who comes to court"
 yearly.7001.d.win.tt: "You scare factions targeting you"

## Letter of warning from your marshal who is a sympathizer

 yearly.7002: "You are in immediate peril, my [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetLadyLord|U]"
 yearly.7002.d: "I feel nothing but shame as I scribe these words. [coup_leader.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has spent months bribing your guards. [coup_leader.GetSheHe|U] plans to stage an attack on your life in front the court... I wish for your life to be spared, but try as I may, I cannot stop my heart from bleeding for the cause of the [coup_faction.GetName].\n\nI have dashed into exile. We shall not meet again."
 yearly.7002.a: "I can trust no one!"
 yearly.7002.b: "I must trust some of my closest [ROOT.Char.Custom('KnightCulturePluralNoTooltipLowercase')] to guard me!"
 yearly.7002.b.tt: "[knight_1.Custom('TitledFirstName')] and [knight_2.Custom('TitledFirstName')] are some of my finest warriors. I must hope they will protect me."
 yearly.7002.c: "I can defend myself!"
 yearly.7002.b.tt.2: "You confide in two of your guards"
 yearly.7002.c.tt: "You keep this a secret"

#### Traitor knights carry you off in a sack
 yearly.7004.desc: ""Hurry! [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetSheHe|U] is waking up!"\n\nAs I awaken, my pillow feels coarser than usual. My head is spinning, but the rest of my body goes with it and everything remains dark. I am not in my bed, but being dragged along the ground in a sack.\n\n"[ROOT.GetCharacter.GetSheHe|U] is squirming too much! I keep losing my grip."\n\nAs the voices bicker, I quite easily struggle enough for them to drop the bag. When I crawl free, I realize they've barely gotten a few paces beyond the [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('FortifiedBuilding')] garden."
 yearly.7004.tt: "The plots of the faction have been foiled"
 yearly.7004.a: "You call this a kidnapping? I'd at least expect you to get to [neighbor_county.GetNameNoTier]."
 yearly.7004.b: "Traitors! You shall both languish in sacks in my dungeon!"
 yearly.7004.c: "Carry me back to my bed at once!"
 yearly.7004.c.tt: "You are returned to the sack and ferried to your chamber"

#### Assassination attempt
##
 yearly.7005.preparation: "It is almost thrilling, sitting and waiting for the [coup_faction.GetName] to strike."
 yearly.7005.preparation_poor: "I have decided to trust no companion but my [ROOT.Char.Custom('SignatureWeaponNameOrType')], and we shall go to [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetAfterLifeDestination')] together, if we must."
 yearly.7005.preparation_good: "It is farcical that they think mere assassins could slay me."
 yearly.7005.knight_support: "[knight_1.Custom('TitledFirstName')] and [knight_2.Custom('TitledFirstName')] are ready to die for me, but I pity anyone who might face their blades."
 yearly.7005.single_knight_support: "I trust my [ROOT.Char.Custom('KnightCulturePluralNoTooltipLowercase')] to support me, after all."
 yearly.7005.decreased_security: "All the guests in my [THIS.GetCharacter.Custom('FortifiedBuilding')] sip on [ROOT.Char.Custom('RegionalDrink')] and glut themselves on gossip without a care."
 yearly.7005.increased_security: "The [THIS.GetCharacter.Custom('FortifiedBuilding')] is quiet, a few groups whisper. All are on edge seeing my throne room lined with guards."
 yearly.7005.throne_approach: "[coup_leader.Custom('TitledFirstName')] approaches my throne."
 yearly.7005.liberty_faction: ""It seems the only way to break the chains around our necks is to slit both mine and yours.""
 yearly.7005.independence_faction: "\n\n"If I cannot have my own state, I must at least be the hero of my own tragedy.""
 yearly.7005.claimant_faction: ""You have no right to languish atop that throne. I would rather die than see you make one more false decree from it.""
 yearly.7005.populist_faction: ""It sorrows me, I swear, that I cannot but grant you a fairer death than the agonies of all those who have been crushed under your foot. At least my end shall be that of a hero.""
 yearly.7005.weapon: "\n\n[coup_leader.GetSheHe|U] pulls out a concealed [coup_leader.Custom('SignatureWeaponNameOrType')] and bolts forth."
 yearly.7005.single_death: "In one dread burst, [coup_leader.GetSheHe] hits [first_character_kill.Custom('TitledFirstName')]"
 yearly.7005.double_death: "In a twofold eruption, [coup_leader.GetSheHe] strikes [first_character_kill.Custom('TitledFirstName')] and [second_character_kill.Custom('TitledFirstName')]"
 yearly.7005.triple_death: "To the horror of all, [coup_leader.GetSheHe] lashes at [first_character_kill.Custom('TitledFirstName')], [second_character_kill.Custom('TitledFirstName')] and [third_character_kill.Custom('TitledFirstName')]."
 yearly.7005.coup_ruler_strike: "before dashing to hit me."
 yearly.7005.no_death: "This brash madness is quickly ended as my [ROOT.Char.Custom('KnightCulturePluralNoTooltipLowercase')] swiftly encircle [coup_leader.GetHerHim]."
 yearly.7005.failure: "As the guards grasp [coup_leader.GetHerHim], I realize [coup_leader.GetSheHe] is furiously trying to push the blade into [coup_leader.GetHerHis] own heart rather than be caught."
 yearly.7005.ruler_death: "Their blood soon mingles with my own as I feel the [coup_leader.Custom('SignatureWeaponNameOrType')] strike my chest."
 yearly.7005.success: "It is foolish to think [coup_leader.GetSheHe] could take my throne in this tiny coup, but as [coup_leader.GetSheHe] turns a blade to [coup_leader.GetHerHis] own throat, I realize this was never what [coup_leader.GetSheHe] wanted."
 yearly.7005.a: "Guards, restrain [coup_leader.GetHerHim], [coup_leader.GetSheHe] cannot become a martyr for dissidents."
 yearly.7005.b: "Let [coup_leader.GetHerHim] do it."
 yearly.7005.c: "You deserve a far worse fate than to die here!"
 yearly.7005.c.tt: "You blind and imprison [coup_leader.Custom('TitledFirstName')]"
 yearly.7005.d: "Exile [coup_leader.GetHerHim], to tell the tale of how hard I am to kill."
 yearly.7005.d.tt: "You will receive all of [coup_leader.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] titles and vassals"
 yearly.7005.devout.e: "You will never join me in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PositiveAfterLife], wretch!"
 yearly.7005.e: "I will slay you in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.NegativeAfterLife], cur!"
