 bp1_yearly.0100.nomadic_host: "Luckily, we've come upon a proper encampment. Unluckily... those within are tribesmen of my foul [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('host'))] [host.Custom('FirstName')].\n\nI am being lashed by the mounting storm."

 bp1_yearly.0101.gentle_flirt: "[lover.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] shivers nearer moment by moment. Is this fear just an act? Something stirs in [lover.GetHerHis] eyes, just behind [lover.GetHerHis] formal smile. [lover.GetHerHis|U] eyes tell me... yes."
 bp1_yearly.0101.protective_flirt: "[lover.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] acts confident, protective. I smile to [lover.GetHerHim] thankfully — obligingly — and before long... [lover.GetSheHe] slips into rapturous silence. [lover.GetSheHe|U] is mine."

 bp1_yearly.0101.finish: "\n\nThe corner we come together in is dark. Quite dark. And nothing we do, with [lover.GetHerHis] hungry body, beneath my dirt-spattered clothes, can be heard through nature's tumult.\n\nThe only sound to touch my lips is a curse on [lover.GetHerHis] [lover.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('host'))]'s name. And, in that very moment, I make my victory complete."

 bp1_yearly.0101.a: "But it's #EMP you#! I dream of, [lover.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]!"
