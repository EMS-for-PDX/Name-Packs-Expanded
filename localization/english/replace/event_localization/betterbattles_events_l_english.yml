 betterbattles.0002.desc: "Finally, a messenger rushes into my tent, informing me that the white drapes have tumbled over the walls of the [bad_barony.GetName]. As the gates to the holding swing open, the church bells ring out signalling surrender, followed by the appearance of [bad_barony_holder.Custom('TitledFirstName')] on horseback with a few of [bad_barony_holder.GetHerHis] guardsmen.\n\n"I know when I am beaten" [bad_barony_holder.GetSheHe] says, after dismounting from [bad_barony_holder.GetHerHis] horse, and kneeling before me.

 betterbattles.0005.desc: "After the siege of the [bad_barony.GetName], two men specifically caught my eye after being captured as prisoners once they had finished frantically fighting some of my levies with pitchforks and a shovel. Glancing over at them from a distance, I notice the two of them grappling eachother, supposedly fighting about an event that had happened mid-siege, before my soldiers had entered the castle walls.\n\nAfter asking what was going on, one of the prisoner guards informed me that [special_soldier_1.Custom('TitledFirstName')] found out that [special_soldier_2.Custom('TitledFirstName')] had apparently used the chaos of the siege to steal some of his gold. On the other hand, [special_soldier_2.Custom('TitledFirstName')] claims that [special_soldier_1.Custom('TitledFirstName')] actually stole HIS gold, and not the other way around.\n\nWhilst normally I wouldn't care about a situation like this, the two are yelling and shouting into the night, and keeping a lot of my men awake."

 betterbattles.0102.desc: "As the Battle of the [battle_location.GetName] rages on, I find myself drawn into the fight more than usual. Picking my fights, I manage to slay a few of the enemy footmen, with the protection of my guardsmen and [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')]. For a moment, I feel indestructable- cutting through waves of foes with my soldiers like a squad of elite warriors. Then it happens.\n\n"My [player_commander.GetLadyLord]!" shouts a familiar voice, as they dive in front of me, and take a fatal blow destined for my chest. The blow came from no other than [bad_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')], who wrenches their blade from the lifeless, bloody body of [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')], and paces towards me with deathly intent."

 betterbattles.0103.desc: "As [bad_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] charges towards me I take a step back, blade at the ready. Swinging [bad_knight.GetHerHis] blade violently at my chest, I block it perfectly, and jab [bad_knight.GetHerHim] in the shoulder of [bad_knight.GetHerHis] sword arm. Whilst [bad_knight.GetSheHe] wails in pain, unable to swing back, I draw my blade to the side and swing it through the base of [bad_knight.GetHerHis] neck.\n\n[bad_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')]'s head tumbles onto the floor before me, eyes and mouth still frantically moving. I stop momentarily to usher a prayer for [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')], but know now is not the time for grief. I return to the battle, shaken, but alive."

[bad_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] swings again, but I perfectly parry the swing and counter with a jab into the stomach. [bad_knight.GetSheHe] cries in pain, as I gash another wound into [bad_knight.GetHerHis] arm, but fail to block [bad_knight.GetHerHis] returning blow into my sword arm.\n\nWe lock eyes for a second, knowing that to continue fighting would be a mutual assurance of death, and are swamped by each of our forces charging past us clashing with one another, as we disappear back towards the rear of our armies for treatment."

 betterbattles.0104.a: "Next time [bad_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] won't be so lucky..."

 betterbattles.0105.desc: "As [bad_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] charges towards me I take a step back, blade at the ready. Swinging [bad_knight.GetHerHis] blade violently at my chest, I'm sent onto my back in the mud, as the strength of [bad_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')]'s strike blows me to the floor. Struggling to my feet, I wipe my eyes and look around, but [bad_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is nowhere to be seen.\n\nThen, I feel a sharp pain in my chest, as I look down to see the tip of [bad_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')]'s blade poking out of my chest. As the blade disappears back inside of me, I watch blood pour out of the wound, before a zip of pain hits my neck and my head is cut from my body. I feel my ear slap into the mud, as I watch my body fall to it's knees before slumping to the ground. [bad_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] spits on the ground, before turning off to continue in the rest of the battle."

 betterbattles.0106.desc: "As [bad_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] charges towards me I take a step back, allowing my guardsmen to cover me whilst I recollect my thoughts. As the rest of my men corner [bad_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] into a pocket of space, I march back in, and deliver the final blow.\n\nAs [bad_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] lies dead on the floor in front of me, a few of my men glance at me in disappointment before I command them to rejoin the main combat force."

 betterbattles.0107.desc: "Noticing a weak spot in our line, I move my personal guard to assist the men before the weak spot turns into a breakpoint.\n\nAs me and my men work to fight back the pressing enemies, I notice a particularly violent encounter happening a short distance to my right. [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has got [good_knight.GetHerselfHimself] encircled by a few of the enemy force's footmen, and is desperately fighting against significant odds. Whilst I have faith in [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')]'s fighting ability, I don't think [good_knight.GetSheHe]'ll last whilst being outnumbered."
 betterbattles.0107.ajh: "Step aside, [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')]. I will handle this."

 betterbattles.0108.desc: "After holding our own for a short while, [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] and I are soon overwhelmed by the numerous foes attacking us. I watch, helplessly caught in my own self defense as [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is slashed in the abdomen, [good_knight.GetHerHis] guts spilling onto the ground. "[good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')]! No!" I yell, filled with rage as I slash through another enemy to reach them.\n\nMy rage, however, quickly exhausts me. I become tired, sluggish, and slow as another few men rush over to try to finish me off. As I stare down at [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')]'s motionless corpse, I'm caught by the blade of one enemy. Then two. Then another dashes into my leg, and I fall to the ground, clutching at my throat that was slashed by the blade of a fourth foe.\n\nAs my sight fades dark I realise I am facing [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] beside me on the floor, before everything fades to black."

 betterbattles.0109.desc: "Rushing to help [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')], I cut through three of the unsuspecting foes surrounding him with ease. As [good_knight.GetSheHe] notices my efforts to help, [good_knight.GetSheHe] gains a second wind of hope, fighting harder the closer I get. "[player_commander.Custom('TitledFirstName')], I owe you my life" says [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')], as a pause in fighting allows us a chance to recollect our thoughts. "It is nothing" I tell [good_knight.GetHerHim], slightly winded, but alive. "You are one of mine, we look after eachother" I add, before wiping off my sword and heading back into the fray.\n\nAs I look over my shoulder, I notice [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] loosely following me, ensuring that my back is protected. I've certainly gained [good_knight.GetHerHis] devout loyalty."

 betterbattles.0110.desc: "As [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] continues to fight on their own against up to five enemy soldiers, I desperately try to find another fight to occupy me from the desperate wailings and gestures coming from [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')]'s direction.\n\nWhilst I put in a shift against the other areas of the front line, I can't help but notice after a while [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')]'s quietness, and how I could've done something."
 betterbattles.0110.a: "I'm sorry, [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')]."

 betterbattles.0111.desc: "Charging into the fray, I raise my blade, and behead one of the larger foes with one fell swing. A few of the other attackers stop, stunned, as I push [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] aside and ready my blade for the others.\n\nA few of them step towards me, and I instantly churn into action. One drops, abdomen slashed open. Another stumbles towards me nervously, before I smash the hilt of my sword into their skull, and then lunge my blade into their chest. One more charges at me, knocking me to the ground, but as they dive down with their warhammer to crush me I roll aside and slash their arm off.\n\nThe armless enemy screams in agony, writhing on the floor, as I stand myself back up, and throw a fearsome gaze at the other attackers who now stand terrified and look at eachother in discomfort. Placing my foot on the armless screaming soldier's chest, I hold him still whilst driving the end of my sword through his neck. As I drag my sword from his corpse, I twirl the weapon in my hand, and step towards the watching enemies, who scurry away in fear. "[player_commander.Custom('TitledFirstName')], I owe you my life" says [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')], stood next to various other knights who are equally stunned by my performance. This will definitely be a moment that I will be remembered for."

I turn to [good_knight.GetHerHim], and wave for silence as [good_knight.GetSheHe] prepares to complain.\n\nOnce the enemy has broken through completely, I divert my men to fill the broken section of our front line, cutting off the source of the attack, and leaving the breaching group of footmen encircled. [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] falls silent, as I order my men to squeeze in on the outflanked attacking soldiers, eliminating the enemy push."

[good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] groans in frustration, before heading over to fix the mess I have made."

[good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] looks down at me, before sighing in disappointment, and hurrying off to fix the mess I've made."
 betterbattles.0116.a: "Where were you, [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')]? Coward!"

 betterbattles.0117.desc: "After sending [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] to halt the enemy advance, I continue working on the strategic execution of other tectical plans I'd made before the battle.

"Did you see that, my [player_commander.GetLadyLord]?!" says [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')], as I look over at the enemy advance to see it demolished, and the battle back in our control."

 betterbattles.0119.desc: ""Follow me, [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')]" I say, before signalling to my personal guardsmen to follow me into the battle. Using my experience, I give [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] tactical commands to follow, whilst maintaining my own authority over the handling of the situation.\n\nBy means of my experience and [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')]'s help, we manage to contain the enemy advance, and we both begin to get stuck in fighting with our front line. I lose [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] in the fray, and have to pray that [good_knight.GetSheHe] makes it out alive. Whilst swinging my blade through countless foes and shouting commands, it's clear to see that my men are glad to have me in command- otherwise, me or [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] might've received more than a cut or bruise..."

 betterbattles.0120.desc: ""There [player_commander.GetSheHe] is!" Shouts a voice from over my shoulder. "It's [player_commander.Custom('TitledFirstName')]!" says someone else, from another direction. "Where are they coming from?" I think to myself, whilst continuously fighting off more and more foes. After a prolongued period of combat, my nearby soldiers desperately try to protect me, but as their numbers dwindle, I begin to take hits from the larger quantity of enemies.\n\nAs the last of my personal guard falls dead on the floor, I look up to see myself surrounded and separated by a short distance from the rest of my army. They have me ten to one."

As we continue to fight the pressing enemies, I find myself cornered with a few of my footmen, and slowly begin to be encircled by the enemies. After taking a deep blow to [good_knight.GetHerHis] shoulder, [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] shuffles off to regain his stamina. My soldiers manage to fend off the attackers, but most of them die in the fray. One enemy remains, and approaches me with malice.\n\n"NO!" yells a voice, from over my assailant's shoulder. To my surprise, [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] appears, and strikes down the foe, potentially saving my life after I'd grown weary from the recent fighting.\n\n"Thank you, [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')]-" I begin, but [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] simply wipes [good_knight.GetHerHis] blade, and staggers towards me, bleeding heavily.

Now spilling blood everywhere but still driven by pure spite, [good_knight.GetSheHe] staggers around aimlessly whilst waggling [good_knight.GetHerHis] sword blindly in my general direction. Eventually, [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] wanders into my space and luckily scratches my face, before allowing me to deliver a brutal kick to [good_knight.GetHerHis] chest, knocking [good_knight.GetHerHim] to the floor.\n\nAs [good_knight.GetSheHe] lays there, choking on [good_knight.GetHerHis] own bubbling blood, I lean over, and drive my blade through [good_knight.GetHerHis] throat."

After taking a blow to the knee, I trip towards [good_knight.GetHerHim], and [good_knight.GetSheHe] is ready, blade in hand, to drive it through my chest. Slumping to my knees, I feel warm ooze start to drip from the wound in my chest, before falling to the ground, lifeless.\n\n[good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] shouts in excitement, before a few of my footmen rush over to desperately console me. Though I am doomed, everyone witnessed [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')]'s dishonourable means of defeating me."

 betterbattles.1000.desc: "Across the battlefield, I see [enemy_commander.Custom('TitledFirstName')] atop his horse. I've always learned to try to get into the position of the enemy, to better understand how they think, and how to prepare for their attacks. But with [enemy_commander.Custom('TitledFirstName')], I can't imagine anything past being disgusted by [enemy_commander.GetHerHis] religious views.\n\n[enemy_commander.GetFaith.GetName] is surely a plainly false religion. I stop to think. Should I keep trying to learn [enemy_commander.GetHerHis] image of the battle, and use that against [enemy_commander.GetHerHim], or should I shut off any invasive religious thoughts?"
 betterbattles.1000.a: "Maybe [enemy_commander.Custom('TitledFirstName')] sees this battle differently..."

 betterbattles.1004.desc: "Cutting through enemies with ease, I find myself picturing my foes like demons, the unclean that I must smite with holy power. Is this just my imagination? Is it just adrenaline, or fear, or some kind of combination of the two? Either way, it feels real to me. Maybe I am being shown these demons as a message from the heavens, telling me to use my divine will as a means to strike the enemy down?\n\nI continue fighting, invograted with holy strength, as I thunder towards [bad_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')]."

Growing tired and weary, I start to fear the worst, as I realise I am completely cut off from the rest of my soldiers. Blinded by ignorance and adrenaline, I start to panic, exhausting myself in the process as I desperately slash into the surrounding enemies. As I start to become unsteady with exhaustion, it happens. I'm knocked to my feet after being tackled by an enemy, who rattled my head with their shield.\n\nFor a second, the entire battlefield becomes swallowed in darkness, and rain starts slashing down in torrents. In the confusion, the soldiers around me panic, and instead of fighting me begin to squabble amongst themselves. Thunder rumbles from over the hills, and the clouds swirl overhead, before a massive bolt of lightning crashes down from the sky, and into the land before me. Seconds after the lightning vanishes, the stormy sky opens a little, beaming light down into a circle around me, and revealing a knight in charcoal-black armour, with steam hissing off of their body as static from the lightning buzzes around their blade.\n\nStill laying on the floor, and now in shock, I watch on, as the black knight smashes their blade into the enemies surrounding me, and shoots charges of blueish lightning from their sword like some kind of black angel. As I bring myself to my feet, I collect my sword, and rear up on the knight, the two of us now fighting back to back against the countless enemies around us.\n\n"Am I dreaming?" I wonder, as the two of us slash through our foes with ease, before I get struck again by an unseen foe, causing me to black out face-first into the dirt beneath me.\n\n"[player_commander.Custom('TitledFirstName')]?" a voice says, as I stretch my eyes open. [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] stands above me, helping me to my feet. As I look around, the enemies that rushed me are gone. "The Black Knight... Where did they go?" I ask, to which [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] replies with a confused expression. "You hurt your head, my liege" [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] explains. I search around for any traces of the knight, before clutching the side of my head, which is lightly dripping blood. Smiling to myself, I wipe the blood from my hand. "[good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')], where did the knight go?" I ask, to which I get no response, but instead [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')] asks for someone to help me back to the physician. "I am not mad!" I shout, before dismissing [good_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')]'s help, and rushing myself back to the war camp."
