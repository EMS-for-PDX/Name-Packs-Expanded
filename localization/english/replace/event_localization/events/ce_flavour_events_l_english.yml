We [ce_pannonian_romance_guest_spawn.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip]s have lived within these lands among the Avars and Slavs for countless generations. But as of late, our towns have become few and our fields have become barren. I fear our [ce_pannonian_romance_guest_spawn.GetCulture.GetName] customs and [ce_pannonian_romance_guest_spawn.GetCulture.GetLanguage.GetName] tongue will soon be lost to the ages. \n\nPerhaps you would listen to our tales and allow us to mingle here at court so others may hear the story of old Pannonia?'"
