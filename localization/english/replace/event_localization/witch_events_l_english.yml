 witch.3014.host.fallback.desc: "The old prayers might not be elaborate, yet nor are they simple. Short and to the point, they hold [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.WitchGodHerHis|U] most sacred and powerful truths. Reciting them again is like falling into a mother's safe embrace."

The following days, [annoying_clergy.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] was incredibly rude to poor [vengeful_desc.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] every chance [annoying_clergy.GetSheHe] got. In the end, [vengeful_desc.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] confronted [annoying_clergy.GetHerHim] about [annoying_clergy.GetHerHis] malicious behavior. [annoying_clergy.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] had nothing to say in [annoying_clergy.GetHerHis] defense."
 witch.4002.wrathful.desc: "I happen to know that [annoying_clergy.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is one mean drunk, and that [annoying_clergy.GetSheHe] is a little infatuated with one of my servants. I had the [wrathful_desc.GetWomanMan] bring a bottle of very expensive and even stronger liquor to [annoying_clergy.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] chambers. Motivated with the promise of a promotion, [wrathful_desc.GetSheHe] got [annoying_clergy.GetHerHim] drunk just in time for [annoying_clergy.Custom('GetReligiousRite')]."
 witch.4002.arrogant.desc: "Even though [annoying_clergy.GetSheHe] tries to hide it, I know [annoying_clergy.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is very concerned about [annoying_clergy.GetHerHis] looks. [annoying_clergy.GetSheHe|U] has an ointment which [annoying_clergy.GetSheHe] applies religiously every morning. I snook into [annoying_clergy.GetHerHis] chambers and added some irritating herbs to it. The next day, [annoying_clergy.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] face was covered with hives!"
 witch.4002.end.desc: "\n\nIt was the only thing my courtiers talked about last night. [annoying_clergy.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] will never live this one down!"
 witch.4002.a: "Serves [annoying_clergy.GetHerHim] right!"

 witch.4003.desc: "Hidden in the secret passage behind [annoying_clergy.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] chambers, I gleefully listen to the [annoying_clergy.Custom('InsultAdjective')] [annoying_clergy.Custom('WomanManPossessive')] groans and sighs. [annoying_clergy.GetSheHe|U] has read the tome I left on [annoying_clergy.GetHerHis] bed — in fact, [annoying_clergy.GetSheHe] has been unable to put it down.\n\nThe truths within seems to have had a significant impact on [annoying_clergy.GetHerHis] faith. "Oh, [annoying_clergy.GetFaith.HighGodName]! I need a sign! I have believed in you, exerted your will on Earth, but now... All I can see are the contradictions, the fallacies, the... the lies!"\n\n[annoying_clergy.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] voice shatters to incoherent sobs."

 witch.4004.desc: "Under the innocent guise of theological queries, I have sowed doubt in [annoying_clergy.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] heart. I can tell [annoying_clergy.GetHerHis] faith is wavering from [annoying_clergy.GetHerHis] uncertain answers and the shadow of worry that falls upon [annoying_clergy.GetHerHis] face when [annoying_clergy.GetSheHe] thinks no one is watching.\n\nI am not there, not yet, but a final attempt #EMP should#! break [annoying_clergy.GetHerHim]."
 witch.4004.a: "It is a worthy effort!"
 witch.4004.b: "My time is better spent on other things."

 witch.4005.desc: "I left a tome of uncomfortable truths in [annoying_clergy.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] chambers, but I saw [annoying_clergy.GetHerHim] throw it in the fire after reading just a few pages. The challenge must have strengthened [annoying_clergy.GetHerHis] faith — I can no longer detect any uncertainty in [annoying_clergy.GetHerHis] heart."
 witch.4005.a: "[annoying_clergy.GetSheHe|U] wasn't worthy, anyway!"
