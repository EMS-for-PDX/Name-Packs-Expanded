 trait_specific.1001.desc: "Strange people have been appearing around court lately – some I only see as shadows in the corner of my eye, and others I glimpse quickly and then they seem to be gone.\n\nNo matter how many guards I set on the task these strange people cannot be found, but the intensity of their taunting is only increasing!"

 trait_specific.1002.desc: "Lately I have had a hard time thinking straight – my thoughts are scattered like clouds upon a summer sky.\n\nThe birds outside my window have started singing another tune.

 trait_specific.2002.desc: "Lately I have experienced some... episodes. Something comes over me, taking charge of my body, and leaves me tired and confused.\n\nI have tried to keep it from people, tried to hide it, but it is hard to control something that comes and goes as it pleases."
 trait_specific.2002.a: "They are looking at me as if I am possessed..."

 trait_specific.3001.desc: "As a stray arrow whiz past my head in the yard I feel nothing – no fear, no anger, no panic.\n\nThis has been par for the course recently – I feel as if I exist behind a curtain, keeping me from feelings and the world. And I am so tired..."

 trait_specific.6001.desc: "Lately regular activities have not... #EMP done#! it for me. Physicians have recommended various ointments, but nothing excites.\n\nAs I grow more and more desperate I stumble upon some books, hidden in the bottom of a pile in a merchants stall, that depict some... unusual activities.

 trait_specific.8501.desc: "I am speaking to several of my courtiers on a rather serious topic, when I can't help but notice [mean_courtier.Custom('TitledFirstName')] snickering.\n\nIt is only when I confront [mean_courtier.GetHerHim] and [mean_courtier.GetSheHe] asks me to repeat the word 'suspicious' that I realise [mean_courtier.GetSheHe] is mocking my lisp."
