 hunt_mystical_animal.1001.desc: "The [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimalDesc')] white [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')] I am hunting comes to me in a dream, judging me with its deep eyes and flaunting its pristine coat of fur.\n\nWe stand in a [ROOT.Char.Custom('TerrainType')], everything around us silent, and no matter how I move I get no closer to my prey.\n\nAs I claw myself awake I feel my resolve hardening."
 hunt_mystical_animal.1001.a: "It will not elude me much longer!"

 hunt_mystical_animal.1002.desc: "I am out with my retinue in [location.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] when the road twists and takes us in close to the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TerrainType')]. It is there I see it once more, shimmering in the sun – the white [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')].\n\nI turn to alert the others, but as I turn back the [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')] is already gone."
 hunt_mystical_animal.1002.a: "It taunts me!"

 hunt_mystical_animal.1003.desc: "Since I started my search reports are coming in from all over the realm of people spotting the [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimalDesc')] white [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')].\n\nTo shift through the accounts and sort fact from fiction is a huge task. If only the reports were more reliable..."
 hunt_mystical_animal.1003.a: "I will employ people to look for it!"
 hunt_mystical_animal.1003.b: "This task is too huge. I'll have none of it."
 hunt_mystical_animal.1003.b.tt: "You will no longer hunt for the animal."
 hunt_mystical_animal.1003.c: "My [steward.GetCouncilTitle] will sort this."
 hunt_mystical_animal.1003.d: "I can do it. I #EMP must#!!"
 hunt_mystical_animal.1003.e: "[m_hunt.Custom('TitledFirstName')], organize a search party!"

 hunt_mystical_animal.1004.desc: ""My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]! We have gotten reports of people seeing the white [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')] in the local forest! They claim that everything from prosperity to sickness follows it, but all seem fairly certain that it's in the area."\n\nIt's here? In [location.GetNameNoTier]?!"
 hunt_mystical_animal.1004.a: "We ride!"
 hunt_mystical_animal.1004.a.tt: "It will not elude me this time."

 hunt_mystical_animal.1005.desc: "\n\nAnd the [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')] bounds away into the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TerrainType')], gone as fast as it appeared."
 hunt_mystical_animal.1005.a: "Curses! I will get you yet!"

 hunt_mystical_animal.1006.desc: "As I look out the window the white [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')] stands there, at the edge of the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TerrainType')], #EMP taunting#! me.\n\nAs I turn away I am faced with the white fabric of my sheets, and as I try to get away from them I run into the head of a [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')], mounted on the wall. I close my eyes and there it is – the white [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')] – laughing at me!"
 hunt_mystical_animal.1006.a: "I WILL GET YOU!"
 hunt_mystical_animal.1006.b: "You! You are now the white [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')]! Come back here!"

 hunt_mystical_animal.1007.desc: "The elusive white [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')] has been spotted!\n\nAs I follow its tracks into a local forest, deeper and deeper into the greenery, things starts to change shape. I see mushrooms as big as a [ROOT.Char.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')], trees as small as a mouse, and caterpillars as big as a horse."
 hunt_mystical_animal.1007.a: "No matter what hole you crawl into I will find you!"
 hunt_mystical_animal.1007.b: "Oh, these mushrooms... They look tasty."

 hunt_mystical_animal.1008.desc: "As the days pass by and I hear nothing about the white [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')] I grow restless.\n\nSurely someone must have seen it? What about all the peasants littering the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TerrainType')]? Maybe I should appeal for their assistance..."
 hunt_mystical_animal.1008.a: "Send a missive!"
 hunt_mystical_animal.1008.b: "I will not sink that low."
 hunt_mystical_animal.1008.c: "I'll send [knight.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]."

 hunt_mystical_animal.1009.desc: ""My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], this search of yours for a mere beast... I have to admit it worries me."\n\n[court_chaplain.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)|U] approaches me as I sift through reports of new sightings of the white [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')]. Evidently anything that demands so much attention could be sent by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName]; as if its existence is not a sign of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate] [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodHerselfHimself]!"
 hunt_mystical_animal.1009.a: "The [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')] is a messenger from [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]."

 hunt_mystical_animal.1009.b: "It is none of your business."
 hunt_mystical_animal.1009.c: "You are right, what have I been thinking?"

 hunt_mystical_animal.9001.desc: "I follow the tracks deeper and deeper into the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TerrainType')] and all grows quiet around me.\n\nAs if born from the air itself the white [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')] suddenly stands before me, fur gleaming in the sunlight and eyes as deep as dreams. I raise my bow..."
 hunt_mystical_animal.9001.a: "... and I let the arrow fly."

 hunt_mystical_animal.9002.desc: ""My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]! A local peasant has sent you a gift. [dummy_peasant_gender.GetSheHe|U] claims this white coloring is natural, but I have never seen anything like it!"\n\nWith rising trepidation I approach the bundle – and there it lies, the white [ROOT.Char.Custom('LocalAnimal')] I have spent years hunting."
 hunt_mystical_animal.9002.a: "This has to be a joke...!"
