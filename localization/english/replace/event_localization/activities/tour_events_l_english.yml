 tour_travel.1001.desc.intro: "I enter a local tavern in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetNameNoTooltip], weary from travel and thirsting for ale and rest.\n\nMy quiet contemplation is disturbed by the sound of a slamming fist on splintering wood followed by a scornful spit. "That [ROOT.Char.Custom('InsultAdjective')] [ROOT.Char.Custom('InsultNoun')]!"
 tour_travel.1001.desc.mid.wrong_language: "[ROOT.Char.GetSheHe|U] doesn't even speak [angry_peasant.GetCulture.GetLanguage.GetName], yet [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] would call [ROOT.Char.GetHerselfHimself] our rightful liege!""

 tour_travel.1001.desc.mid.wrong_faith: "[ROOT.Char.GetSheHe|U] is a [ROOT.Char.Custom('InsultAdjective')] infidel! Every second that [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] remains on the throne is an affront to [angry_peasant.GetFaith.HighGodNamePossessive] will.""
 tour_travel.1001.desc.mid.pretender: "The House of [ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetName], I spit on them all! Everyone knows the true rulers of [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] are those of house [claimant_character_scope.GetHouse.GetName].""
 tour_travel.1001.desc.mid.powerful_diarch: "Our so-called [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')|U] is weak! The true ruler of [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] is that [ROOT.Char.GetDiarch.Custom('InsultAdjective')] [ROOT.Char.GetDiarch.Custom('InsultNoun')], [ROOT.Char.GetDiarch.Custom('FirstName')]!""
 tour_travel.1001.desc.mid.just_plain_dislike_em: "We shouldn't even be calling that [ROOT.Char.Custom('InsultNoun')] our [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')], we should be calling [ROOT.Char.GetHerHim] a [ROOT.Char.Custom('InsultAdjective')] fool!""
 tour_travel.1001.desc.outro.nudist: "\n\nI try to keep my profile low, but it appears that my [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')|l]ly manner and the unmistakable perfection of a well-groomed [ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetName] body has given me away. I must think of something before the situation escalates."
 tour_travel.1001.desc.outro: "\n\nI try to keep my profile low, but it appears that my [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')|l]ly manner and [ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetName] on my garments has given me away. I must think of something before the situation escalates."
 tour_travel.1001.a: "Say it to my face, you [angry_peasant.Custom('InsultNoun')]!"

 tour_travel.1002.desc: "As we ride through [pretty_peasant_county_scope.GetName], I find myself becoming infatuated with the scenery. Truly the [pretty_peasant_county_scope.GetProvince.Custom('TerrainTypeProvince')] of [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetNameNoTooltip] must be the fairest in all of [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], and fairer still are the [pretty_peasant.GetWomenMen] who call it home.\n\nAs my entourage escorts me through yet another lowly village, I find a particularly fair young [pretty_peasant.GetWomanMan] going about [pretty_peasant.GetHerHis] lowly duties and I feel my heart grow aflutter. Watching this [pretty_peasant.Custom('LoverPetName')] in [pretty_peasant.GetHerHis] mundanity is like seeing poetry made flesh, and before I can even think, my heart has already commanded me to call my entourage to a halt."
 tour_travel.1002.a: "I must make my feelings known."
 tour_travel.1002.b: "Oh I thought I saw something... keep moving."

 tour_travel.1003.desc: "As my tour continues to progress across the [angry_county_scope.GetName] countryside, I am informed that I have made arrangements to meet with a representative of the disgruntled peasantry.\n\nA pitiable creature grovels before me, arguing about the alleged dignity of the [angry_county_scope.GetAdjective] commonfolk. However, it soon comes to my attention that the [rude_peasant.Custom('InsultAdjective')] [rude_peasant.Custom('InsultNoun')] has never once addressed me as 'my [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')]', a crime which may be punished in any way I see fit."
 tour_travel.1003.a: "Have this creature whipped for five miles."

 tour_travel.1004.desc.intro: "I enter [diseased_county_scope.GetName], ready to bestow my royal touch upon the local peasantry. I am immediately faced with what is undoubtedly the most wretched creature I have ever laid eyes upon. With minimal provocation, [diseased_peasant.GetSheHe] exposes [diseased_peasant.GetHerHis] calloused feet just inches from my pristine hands.\n\n"
 tour_travel.1004.desc.outro.christian: "Much as Christ washed the feet of his disciples, I too am implored by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] to wash the feet of my loyal subjects."

 tour_travel.1004.d.two_veg: "Get those filthy [ROOT.Char.Custom('get_region_root_vegetable_plural')] away from me!"

 tour_travel.1005.title: "$altruism_intent_header$ The Royal Touch"
 tour_travel.1005.desc: "Word of my arrival seems to have spread to [county_to_bless_scope.GetName], as our entourage is soon beset with countless serfs begging to be blessed with the royal touch.\n\nI could of course simply sprinkle a little water blessed by myself upon them, and they would surely be satisfied, but granting them blessed coins to soothe their infected areas would keep them happy and blessed for much longer."
 tour_travel.1005.a: "I shall distribute blessed coins."
 tour_travel.1005.b: "A sprinkling of water should satisfy them."
 tour_travel.1005.c: "They get nothing!"

This is perhaps a great opportunity to show the people of [county_to_bless_scope.GetNameNoTooltip] just how magnanimous and kind of a liege I can be."
 tour_travel.1006.a: "Alms for the poor!"
 tour_travel.1006.b: "If they wanted money, they shouldn't have been born poor."

 tour_travel.1007.desc.intro: "As my procession continues on our journey throughout my realm, we end up traveling through the remote and unsuspecting region of [wise_woman_barony_scope.GetNameNoTier]. I'd have thought nothing of it, but [superstituous_courtier_scope.GetName] pulls me aside to enthusiastically espouse the virtue of the so-called "Wise [wise_woman_scope.GetWomanMan|U] of [wise_woman_barony_scope.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]".\n\n"

 tour_travel.1007.desc.mid.psychological: ""I know you have a tortured mind, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], and it causes you great anguish.

 tour_travel.1007.desc.mid.weakened: ""With your injuries, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], I fear for your continued safety and health on this tour.

 tour_travel.1008.desc.mid.psychological: "[wise_woman_scope.GetHerHis|U] hands move to grip my skull like a great beast grasping its prey. We spend the night chanting words I do not understand, and when I emerge in the morrow, I feel my head is lighter."

 tour_travel.1009.desc.mid.ill: "I spend the entire night huffing absolutely intolerable stenches, drinking foul viscous fluids, and having my body coated in stinging weeds! The entire experience adds even more nausea and pain to my existing affliction, and I end the night feeling worse than I started."
 tour_travel.1009.desc.mid.ugly: "[wise_woman_scope.GetSheHe|U] spends the entire night lathering my face in colorful pastes and creams, coating my many blemishes and rough spots. In the morning, I behold my reflection and howl in fear as I behold the monster [wise_woman_scope.GetSheHe] turned me into!"
 tour_travel.1009.desc.mid.nothing: "I do everything the woman asks: I drink herbal teas, have my appendages rubbed, stand over flames, and ingest enough herbs to fell a man. All of this, however seems to have had little effect on me and I feel no better than when I arrived."
 tour_travel.1009.desc.outro: "\n\nI know not what [superstituous_courtier_scope.GetNameNoTooltip] had heard about this "wise" [wise_woman_scope.GetWomanMan], but it has become clear that [wise_woman_scope.GetSheHe] is little more than a common roadside mountebank."
