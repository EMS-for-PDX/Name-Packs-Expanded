 hajj.3010.t: "Place of Abraham"
 hajj.3010.desc: "Having entered Mecca, my first task is to visit the Place of Abraham.

I should do the same."

 hajj.3020.desc: "My next task is to walk, seven times, between the two holy points Safa and Marwah in order to commemorate Hajar's desperation and efforts to find water for her son Ismail.\n\nIsmail, who later on became the forefather of the blessed Prophet.\n\nAs I prepare myself for the rite, I take in the sight of the Safa and Marwah and note the large amount of pilgrims already making their way between the hills from all walks of life."
 hajj.3020.a: "Why settle for seven!"
 hajj.3020.b: "A meticulous seven laps will do."
 hajj.3020.c: "Will anyone notice if I go fewer times?"
 hajj.3020.c.success.t: "Laziness Successful"
 hajj.3020.c.success.desc: "You successfully skimp on the amount of laps taken"

 hajj.3021.desc: "As I start making my way back from the two hills, one of the local clergy looks at me with a stern face: "I #EMP believe#! you did not complete the Safa and Marwah rite properly, Hajji."\n\n[penalizer.GetSheHe|U] continues: "The penalty for such actions is either the Damm or the Sadaqah al-Fitr. Or you can always do the laps properly, of course," [penalizer.GetHerHis] face softens for a split second.\n\n"The Hajj will be incomplete should you abstain, so what's it going to be, Hajji?""
 hajj.3021.a: "Animal sacrifice it is."

 hajj.3021.c.flavor_zealous: "I #EMP knew#! I should have taken it seriously..."
 hajj.3021.c.flavor: "Oh bother."
 #Drink water from the Zamzam well
 hajj.3030.t: "Zamzam Well"
 hajj.3030.desc: "Here I am, standing in front of the mystical Zamzam well, the one discovered through the dreams of an eternal spring in the desert. Drinking its water is one of the ancient rites of the Hajj, and as such, my next undertaking.\n\nThe well, while sprung out of intricate stone work, is entrenched with Hajj pilgrims to my left, right and center, and I must push myself through the crowd to advance to the sanctified water shared by many."
 hajj.3030.a: "I should let the others go first."
 hajj.3030.a.flavor: "I am in no rush."

 hajj.3040.t: "Sacrifice to Allah"
 hajj.3040.desc: "Time has come for the next rite: sacrifice to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]. A special part of the ceremonial grounds have been prepared for this occasion, and the musky scent grows stronger as I approach the stalls supplying various types of animals.\n\nI consider my options carefully; sacrificing a large animal such as a camel would certainly be more pious — while sacrificing a smaller animal or sheep would certainly be plenty in order to complete the Hajj.\n\n Some pilgrims in a corner also seem to have chipped in and divided the cost for a large cow between themselves."
 hajj.3040.a: "Sixty-three camels!"
 hajj.3040.a.flavor: "I shan't be worse than the grand prophet!"
 hajj.3040.b: "One camel should be plenty."
 hajj.3040.b.flavor: "Camels know the one secret..."
 hajj.3040.c: "Let's go with a sheep."
 hajj.3040.c.flavor: "I never liked their beady eyes anyway."
 hajj.3040.d: "I'll get in on that cow sacrifice over there."
 hajj.3040.d.flavor: "Why extinguish more lives than necessary?"

 hajj.3001.desc: "Having prayed at the Place of Abraham, walked between Safa and Marwah, drunk water from the Zamzam well and sacrificed to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], I am now ready to complete the Hajj. The next rite I must undertake is to cut my hair.\n\n"
