 pilgrimage.2002.desc:0 "Among my fellow pilgrims, there is a [dummy_gender.GetWomanMan] who preaches compassion and fellowship — until [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] reaches the topic of heathens.\n\nOne evening around the campfire, [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] loudly declares them to be "abominable monsters in the eyes of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm]! Deviants and child murderers all!" Most people avert their eyes when [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] looks at them. Tonight, I was not quick enough. "Do you not agree, o [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')]?""

 pilgrimage.2005.desc: "Passing by the campfire, one of my fellow travelers is telling a story [dummy_peasant_gender.GetSheHe] once heard about some [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')], to raucous laughter. They all fall silent when I approach — except for the storyteller.\n\n"Ah, don't worry, m'[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], you're nothing like the [ROOT.Char.Custom('InsultNoun')] in this story!"

 pilgrimage.2010.desc:0 "[mystic.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is one of the stranger people I have met on this journey. [mystic.GetSheHe|U] seems to be a firm believer, but also expounds on the true nature of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] and what it all means. At night, [mystic.GetHerHis] tent is lit up by the candles within, and occasionally strange chanting and unusual incense flows from it.\n\nI am wholly unprepared when [mystic.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] bids me to enter."

 pilgrimage.2011.desc:0 "Inside [mystic.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] tent, I am greeted by strong smells and an overwhelmingly hot and heavy air. "It is important that we turn our gaze within ourselves," [mystic.GetSheHe] explains and takes a seat.\n\n"I want you to close your eyes and focus, as I do. Let [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm] flow through you. Reach for the ecstasy of divinity!""

 pilgrimage.2013.desc:0 "After following [mystic.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] instructions, I can see it all much more clearly. I can #EMP feel#! it. [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm|U], the world, it has all been coursing through my body. Through my soul.\n\nWhen I emerge from the tent hours later, I have a new understanding of myself, and of life."

 pilgrimage.2014.desc:0 "When I wake up from falling asleep in [mystic.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] tent, the tent itself is gone. My servants are rousing me from the mat I fell asleep on, but there is no other trace of the mystic.\n\nAt least the sleep was invigorating!"

 pilgrimage.2015.desc:0 "I'll be honest, I never expected [mystic.Custom('TitledFirstName')] to be able to answer for [mystic.GetHerHis] strange practices as well as [mystic.GetSheHe] did.\n\nI am still suspicious of... whatever it is [mystic.GetSheHe] is up to, but I have certainly gotten some fresh perspectives to consider!"

 pilgrimage.3301.c:0 "Ah, but is against Ṛta for a [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')] to travel in austerity."

 pilgrimage.4002.desc:0 "I am finally here, body and soul, at the end of my great pilgrimage. And who should meet me there but [mystic.Custom('TitledFirstName')], the seeker of true knowledge of the divine?\n\n"Look around you, [ROOT.Char.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]!" [mystic.GetSheHe] says. "Is this glory not as I said it would be?""
