 # Custom
 homage_delivery_stutter_liege: "[ROOT.Char.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] barely reaches halfway through a sentence before [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] stammer cuts [ROOT.Char.GetHerHim] short. My pained courtiers watch [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] valiant attempts to conquer [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] voice."
 homage_delivery_lisp_liege: "[ROOT.Char.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] speech is... memorable. [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] sigmatism takes the edge off its gravity, as [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] navigates its many sibilant sounds, and tries to ignore the giggles of my less generous courtiers."
 homage_delivery_wheeze_liege: "[ROOT.Char.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] is an interesting one. Clearly nervous of the spectacle, and excited by their hurried arrival, [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] seems to struggle even to breath, rasping through the speech between breaks for air."
 homage_delivery_slow_liege: "[ROOT.Char.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] speech is... not good. [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] loses [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] train of thought at several points, rambling into tangents, and misunderstanding or mispronouncing some of the most important words."
 homage_delivery_inconceivable_liege: "[ROOT.Char.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] speech is... interesting. [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe|U] inserts archaic language and weighty words [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] clearly has no notion of the real meaning of, doubling the length and my more learned courtiers over."
 homage_delivery_stutter_vassal: "I have barely begun the first pledge when my stammer cuts me short. I eventually push on as the court watches with mirth and embarrassment, but the day is marked by my affliction."
 homage_delivery_lisp_vassal: "My speech is punctuated by stifled giggles as I try my best to enunciate around my lisp, detracting from the weight of the ceremony and my pledge."
 homage_delivery_wheeze_vassal: "I struggle to find the breath as my heart races faster, and rushing to finish the speech only makes things worse. It is not a speech to remember."
 homage_delivery_slow_vassal: "I do my best, but the raised eyebrows and looks of my liege and the court tell me my efforts have been amusing rather than momentous."
 homage_delivery_inconceivable_vassal: "I pull out all the stops, meeting the occasion and impressing the court with my great vocabulary, though... the reaction is not exactly what I hoped for."
