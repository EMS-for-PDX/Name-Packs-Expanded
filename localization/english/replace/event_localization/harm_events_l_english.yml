 harm.0000.tt.physician: "#EMP [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetRandomCourtMedic')|U]! [medic.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]!#!"

 harm.0011.desc.default_body: "With the conflict in [battle_location.GetName] over, the wounded and the maimed limp away from the battlefield, whilst the most noteworthy of the dead are carried off by friends and retainers.\n\nFor my own part, I was caught in some of the thickest fighting — little finesse to be had, just hacking, screaming, and killing. My head stills spins from the blows and adrenaline, the surges of fear and rage and exultation and...\n\nSp-spinning. My head is spinning. My vision blurs, then doubles, and I begin to topple into the [ROOT.Char.Custom('GritType')].\n\n"Fetch a [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetRandomBattlefieldMedic')|U], the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')] has been struck!", goes the cry,"
 harm.0011.desc.medic_present: "and the last thing I see is [medic.Custom('TitledFirstName')] pushing through the crowd."

 harm.0011.b: "[medic.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]. Please. My #EMP head.#!"

 harm.0011.b.tt.failure: "[medic.Custom('FirstNamePossessive')|U] best just wasn't good enough"

 harm.0512.desc: "Riding the wilds near [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName] is a simple, pleasurable part of life as [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsName')] of [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier]. Something I can enjoy, in solace or with my entourage, when the day-to-day of rule grows too much.\n\nLost in my thoughts, I almost fail to notice when my steed catches sight of some threatening small reptile and goes to buck. Quickly taking a firmer grasp of the reins, I calm her.\n\nOur ride continues."

 harm.0552.desc: "As the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')], I don't get much time by myself. Minders and guards are everywhere, keeping me safe from both harm and any sense of fun.\n\nFinally, though, I've managed the lot! It took a little daring, but they don't know the route past the walls that #EMP I#! know.\n\nI can't use it too often, but when I do, all of [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName] stretches out before me. Freedom."

 harm.0562.desc: "Climbing the steps down from my bedchamber, I find myself all but clutching at the wall.\n\nThis... this should be simple. Yet it seems so difficult, so foreboding, the narrow stairway stretching out before me like eternity itself...\n\nNo, no. I'm being over-dramatic. I am the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsName')] and I can leave my room unassisted."

 harm.0571.desc: "Training [sparring_partner.Custom('TitledFirstName')] to be a better fighter is one of my more onerous duties, but still something entailed by being the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsName')].\n\nToday's bout has been especially frustrating, with [sparring_partner.Custom('FirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] showing poorer than ever. I sometimes wonder if—\n\nPain blossoms through my skull. I... did [sparring_partner.GetSheHe] catch me #EMP on the temple#!? What kind of #EMP idiot#!..."

 harm.0572.desc: "Sparring in the courtyard of my dwelling at [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName], [sparring_partner.Custom('TitledFirstName')] and I lock our practice blades together in a dance that, on the battlefield, likely would've resulted in [sparring_partner.GetHerHim] dying a thousand times over.\n\n[sparring_partner.GetSheHe|U]'s simply not the warrior I am.\n\nStill, it's necessary training for someone supposed to represent me on the battlefield, so I make the time t—by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.WarGodName], that blow almost caught me in the skull!"

 harm.0582.desc: "Bathing alone is a rare treat for me. As the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsName')], I am attended at all times, either by genuine servants or else by vassals looking to have a quiet word without interruption, and even something as intimate as cleaning myself is subject to that.\n\nGently leveraging my languid form from the bath, I grip the edge and step towards an awaiting stack of folded towels.\n\nExcept... not quite. My foot, still wet, slips, and it's only through reflex that I stop myself toppling to the floor."

 harm.0601.desc: "As we often do, [playmate.Custom('FirstName')] and I are playing in a disused part of my palace.\n\nFirm friends, we can #EMP always#! find some way to entertain ourselves, and it's nice to have someone who isn't a guard or a minder around for a change.\n\nToday, we're mock-wrestling far from the stuffy guardians that'd usually intervene. It's been a lot of fun! Except... except that last choke-hold left me feeling a little dizzy and... #DIE1 and...#!"

 harm.0602.desc: "I love playing with [playmate.Custom('FirstName')], [playmate.GetSheHe] always knows what we can do to have fun!\n\nClimbing buildings, spooking animals, tricking my courtiers... it's all just a bit of a laugh, and it livens up the court. I just want to have fun with [playmate.GetHerHim] forever."

 harm.0622.desc: ""Barkeep, another round!" I cry, to much whooping and hollering.\n\nAs a cheer goes up from the rest of the taver-*HIC*-ngoers, I smile. Half of [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName] must be in here by now, all cheering and whooping for their [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsName')].\n\nAfter all, who can sink a pint quite like #EMP me#!?"

 harm.0631.desc: "[bonker.Custom('FirstName')] makes me feel like the world's luckiest [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan]. On evenings like this, when our love can take physical expression, [bonker.GetHerHis] affection is self-eminent.\n\nMy fingers curl, my eyes roll, and I surge towards my lifetime's most enthusiastic lover.\n\nBlood-pounding, I can barely focus. Blood. Blood... pounding... What is... this isn't..."
 harm.0631.a: "Wait — I can't — my chest!"

 harm.0632.desc: "By all the stars up above, [bonker.Custom('FirstName')] brings out the fiercest fires of love in me. No [bonker.GetWomanMan] is capable of giving me so wild an experience, so pleasurable a night as [bonker.GetSheHe], and at this instant, I can't think of any—\n\n...\n\n—one I'd rather be with."
 harm.0632.a: "[bonker.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] makes me feel so #EMP alive#!."

 harm.1051.desc: "I am awoken by a scream of "[ROOT.Char.Custom('TitledFirstName')]!" from outside, the warning cry of a horrified servant.\n\nAs I crash back to wakefulness, I feel the sweet soaking my body, closely followed by the searing, scorching heat. The sitting room is on fire, my skin already half-blistered from the blaze!\n\nI've g-*COUGH*-ot to get out of here, how did this even... #EMP blasted candles#!!\n\nThe fire is blocking the door, and it's only growing worse."

 harm.1071.desc: "The door all but bursts off its hinges as I walk past it, [other.Custom('TitledFirstName')] fleeing as hard and as fast as [other.GetSheHe] can, sending me sprawling backwards.\n\nI see a flash of silvery steel behind [other.GetHerHim], and the snarl of [killer.Custom('TitledFirstName')] as [killer.GetSheHe] gives chase, knife already flashing towards me — the anger falters as the [killer.GetWomanMan] realizes that I am #EMP not#! [killer.GetHerHis] intended victim, but [killer.GetHerHis] uncontrolled lunge is moving too fast to stop.\n\nThe dagger's tip races for my neck."

 harm.1072.desc: ""And another thing you [other.Custom('InsultAdjective')] [other.Custom('InsultNoun')]", shrieks [killer.Custom('TitledFirstName')], laying into [other.Custom('TitledFirstName')] for what must easily be their third screaming match of the day.\n\nI ignore their bickering despite the volume, continuing on past. The two are constantly arguing, and though loud, they're ultimately harmless.\n\nI've got bigger things to worry about than some little spat between courtiers."

 harm.1102.desc: "Riding with my entourage through the streets of [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName], I maintain an austere manner. It's important to be seen, sometimes, but it's just as important to remain a figure of some authority.\n\nWe pull to a halt as a cart goes rattling past us at a busy cross-section, entirely too fast to be at all safe.\n\nLucky thing for the driver, too — it's not wise to cut the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')] off, but their horse carries them too fast to see, let alone stop."
 harm.1102.a: "The commoners do need to see their [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')]."

 harm.2041.desc: "Even I have all but lost track of how many years we've been at war for. The campaign trail is hard on all of us, taking a little more each day and offering only the barest respite with each evening's camp.\n\nMaking my way back to my tent after a discussion with the quartermaster, I find the place strangely deserted. No tired guards, no bitter mercenaries, no homesick levies. Deserted, that is, until half a dozen armed and mailled soldiers slide out from the shadows on all sides of me.\n\n"[ROOT.Char.Custom('TitledFirstName')]", spits the lead rebel, "your foolhardy wars have cost us all too dearly. For once, #EMP you'll#! pay the price.""

 harm.2061.c: "Blast the horn, the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')] requires aid!"

 harm.2071.c: "Rally! Rally to the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')]!"
