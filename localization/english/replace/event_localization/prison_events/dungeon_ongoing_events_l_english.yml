 dungeon_ongoing.0004.desc: "I thought the wound was almost healed, but now it has started burning. I cannot look at it properly in the dark, but it feels bulbous to the touch.\n\nI cannot tell if the moistness accompanying the searing pain is blood, pus, or condensation from the dank air."

 dungeon_ongoing.0009.desc: "I do not know how I would have survived down here without the comfort that my dear [ROOT.Char.Custom('prison_pet')] provides.\n\nWhenever I feel sad it is there to comfort me, whenever I feel like giving up it urges me on.

 dungeon_ongoing.9001.desc: "I do not recall the last time I saw the sun. I do not recall the last time I had solid food, or solid anything else. It feels like the dampness in the air has fastened itself in my lungs. If a tooth hurts, I simply pull it out of my rotting gums."

 dungeon_ongoing.9002.t: "Hollow"

 dungeon_ongoing.9003.t: "Recollection"
 dungeon_ongoing.9003.desc: "Will I ever be let out of here? Am I simply locked up, abandoned and forgotten? Does anyone but the gaoler know I am here? Is there anyone left who knows my name? Who knows who I was?"

 dungeon_ongoing.9004.t: "Abandonment"
