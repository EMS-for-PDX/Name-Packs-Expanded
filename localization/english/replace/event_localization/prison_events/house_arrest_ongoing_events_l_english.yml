 house_arrest_ongoing.0001.desc: "Every day spent as a prisoner of [prison_holder.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is another day that my carefully laid plans slip further from my grasp.\n\nThe true punishment is not the bodily confinement I find myself under, it is being so incapacitated!"

 house_arrest_ongoing.0002.desc: "Who does [prison_holder.Custom('TitledFirstName')] think [prison_holder.GetSheHe] is?! To keep me here, caged like an animal, and then to have the audacity to claim that it is justice.\n\nAs if anyone besides [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] has the right to judge #EMP me#!."

 house_arrest_ongoing.0003.desc_friendly_prisoner: "\n\nThe only thing that gets me through the long days is my connection with [friendly_prisoner.Custom('TitledFirstName')]."

 house_arrest_ongoing.0003.e: "[ROOT.Char.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] is my one source of comfort and love."

 house_arrest_ongoing.0004.desc: "\n\nMy dear [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('friend_at_court') )], [friend_at_court.Custom('TitledFirstName')], is always thinking of me and doing [friend_at_court.GetHerHis] best to make my punishment more comfortable."

 house_arrest_ongoing.0005.desc: ""Oh, you should have seen the mummers at the festival. What a show!"\n\nBeing locked up here is bad enough. Also having to deal with my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('rival_at_court') )] [rival_at_court.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] mockery is too much. [rival_at_court.GetSheHe|U] goes out of [rival_at_court.GetHerHis] way to make my life as miserable as [rival_at_court.GetSheHe] can, now that I am brought so low."
