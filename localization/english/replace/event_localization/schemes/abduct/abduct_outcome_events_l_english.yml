 abduct_outcome.1002.desc: "A perfect opportunity has presented itself! [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] will be traveling from the [target.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')] to the nearby town, with nary any guards.\n\n[target.GetSheHe|U] must think [target.GetHerselfHimself] safe..."

 abduct_outcome.1003.desc: "With my agents coming and going freely at the court in [court_location.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is within reach!\n\nThe agents are in position to let in a small group of people in the middle of the night, and to cover them as they depart undetected. Ideally while muffling the screams of a kicking burlap sack."

 abduct_outcome.2001.desc: "Success! The brigands did their job admirably, and [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is safely in my hands."

 abduct_outcome.2002.desc: "Before [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] even knew what was happening, my agents had [target.GetHerHim]! [target.GetSheHe|U] is finally in my hands."

 abduct_outcome.2003.desc: "I cannot believe it worked! It was as simple as letting some of my allies into the [target.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')] in the middle of the night. \n\n[target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is no doubt kicking [target.GetHerselfHimself] over the poor security. Thankfully it's a lot better where [target.GetSheHe] is now."

 abduct_outcome.4003.opening: "No! My allies were discovered trying to break into [target.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] chambers. I should have known it would not be this easy."
