 abduct_outcome.1001.no_arrival: "within the [departure.GetNameNoTooltip]."
 abduct_outcome.1001.ending: "\n\nI have arranged for some brigands to interrupt [target.GetHerHis] little journey and make sure [target.GetSheHe] arrives here instead."
 abduct_outcome.1001.a: "Soon [target.GetSheHe] will be at my mercy!"
 abduct_outcome.1001.b: "No, the risk is too great."

 abduct_outcome.1002.desc: "A perfect opportunity has presented itself! [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is traveling from [departure.GetNameNoTooltip] to [arrival.GetNameNoTooltip], with nary any guards.\n\n[target.GetSheHe|U] must think [target.GetHerselfHimself] safe..."
 abduct_outcome.1002.a: "The perfect time to strike!"

 abduct_outcome.1003.desc: "With my agents coming and going freely at the court in [court_location.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is within reach!\n\nThe agents are in position to let in a small group of people in the middle of the night, and to cover them as they depart undetected. Ideally while muffling the screams of a kicking burlap sack."
 abduct_outcome.1003.a: "I like the sound of this plan!"

 abduct_outcome.2001.desc: "Success! The brigands did their job admirably, and [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is safely in my hands."
 abduct_outcome.2001.a: "I hope [target.GetSheHe] likes [target.GetHerHis] new quarters..."

 abduct_outcome.2002.desc: "Before [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] even knew what was happening, my agents had [target.GetHerHim]! [target.GetSheHe|U] is finally in my hands."

 abduct_outcome.2003.desc: "I cannot believe it worked! It was as simple as letting some of my allies into the [target.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')] in the middle of the night. \n\n[target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is no doubt kicking [target.GetHerselfHimself] over the poor security. Thankfully it's a lot better where [target.GetSheHe] is now."

 abduct_outcome.4001.opening: "Curses! [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] escaped my hired bandits, and safely made [target.GetHerHis] way back to [departure.GetNameNoTier]."
 abduct_outcome.4001.owner_discovered: "\n\nDisastrously, one of the brigands was later captured and confessed to everything, including my involvement!"
 abduct_outcome.4001.owner_secret: "\n\nAt least no one will ever know the brigands were working for me."
 abduct_outcome.4001.a: "I will find some other way of dealing with [target.GetHerHim]."
 abduct_outcome.4001.b: "[target.GetHerHis|U] luck will not last. Time to try again!"

 abduct_outcome.4002.opening: "How could this happen?! My agents were waiting and waiting at the correct time and place, but [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] never appeared!"
 abduct_outcome.4002.owner_discovered: "\n\n[target.GetSheHe|U] seems to have gotten wind that I was planning something!"
 abduct_outcome.4002.owner_secret: "\n\n[target.GetSheHe|U] must have gotten wind that something was going on, but at least [target.GetSheHe] will never know that I was involved."

 abduct_outcome.4003.opening: "No! My allies were discovered trying to break into [target.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] chambers. I should have known it would not be this easy."
 abduct_outcome.4003.owner_discovered: "\n\nWhat's worse, they confessed and gave up my involvement in the plot!"
 abduct_outcome.4003.owner_secret: "\n\nBy some miracle my allies made it out, and my involvement remains unknown."

 abduct_outcome.5001.t: "Abducted!"
 abduct_outcome.5001.opening: "I have been abducted by [owner.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)]!"
 abduct_outcome.5001.seized_roadside: "\n\nI was traveling with my retinue when we were accosted by brigands. I do not know what happened to the others, as a sack was pulled over my head. When it was finally removed, I found myself a prisoner in [prison_location.GetNameNoTier]."
 abduct_outcome.5001.on_the_way: "\n\nI was on my way to town with just a handful of guards, and [owner.GetSheHe] knew to strike when I would be at my most vulnerable!"
 abduct_outcome.5001.unwelcome_guests: "\n\nA group of strangers broke into my chambers in the middle of the night. Traitors must have let them into the [ROOT.Char.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')], and I thought my life was over. However, they pulled a sack over my head and dragged me out. Tied up, I was brought here to this dank dungeon."
 abduct_outcome.5001.a: "Just wait until I get out of here!"

 abduct_outcome.5002.t: "Abduction Prevented!"
 abduct_outcome.5002.seized_roadside: "I was traveling in [departure.GetNameNoTier] when a group of bandits came down upon us.\n\nI managed to ride to safety, for it was clear that the brigands were unwilling to hurt me. Instead they were attempting to capture me alive!"
 abduct_outcome.5002.on_the_way: "I was on my way to town with only a handful of guards when they struck.\n\nThankfully, the ones I did have with me acted swiftly and courageously, and I was safely back in the [target.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')] before long."
 abduct_outcome.5002.unwelcome_guests: "A commotion woke me in the middle of the night. A group of thugs had been let into the [ROOT.Char.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')], and were only discovered once at the door to my chambers!"
 abduct_outcome.5002.fallback: "I have escaped an abduction attempt!"
 abduct_outcome.5002.owner_known: "\n\nThis is undoubtedly the work of none other than my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('owner'))], [owner.Custom('TitledFirstName')]!"
 abduct_outcome.5002.owner_not_known: "\n\nI do not know who are behind this kidnapping attempt, but they are still out there..."
 abduct_outcome.5002.a: "Oh, [owner.GetSheHe] will pay!"
 abduct_outcome.5002.b: "I must be on my guard."
