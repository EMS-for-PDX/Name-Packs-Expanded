 ##I am a player, do I want to take the risk?
 elope_event_title: "Elope:"
 elope.0001.t: "$elope_event_title$ Protected by Shadows"
 elope.0001.positive.desc: "The final preparations are in place. The escape route has been charted, the guards bribed and [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is ready. Tonight, as darkness falls over [location.GetNameNoTooltip], I shall set my [target.Custom('LoverPetName')] free and make [target.GetHerHim] my [target.GetWifeHusband]."
 elope.0001.negative.desc: "I go through the list in my head. The escape route has been charted, the guards should have received their bribes and hopefully the note I sent to [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] reached [target.GetHerHim] in time. But what if it did not? Maybe [target.GetSheHe] hasn't received it at all! And there are so many other things that might have gone wrong...\n\nThere is no time for doubt. This is my only chance. I must go to [target.GetHerHim], come what may, or abandon the endeavor."
 elope.0001.a: "I am coming for you, [target.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]!"
 elope.0001.b: "What am I doing? This is madness!"

 elope.1001.t: "$elope_event_title$ Love Endures"
 elope.1001.start.desc: "As we wait, I cannot help but imagine everything that might go wrong. I feel utterly powerless — a feeling that I #EMP don't#! care to get further acquainted with.\n\nI spot a torch ahead, moving in our direction, and gesture to my guards to hide."
 elope.1001.start.desc_brave: "As we wait, I cannot help but wonder where [target.Custom('FirstName')] is now. Did [target.GetSheHe] make it out okay? Will there be pursuers?\n\nI spot a torch ahead, moving in our direction, and gesture to my guards to hide."
 elope.1001.end.desc: "The light moves closer and we can make out two silhouettes. One is carrying a sword, that much is clear. The other... it must be #EMP [target.GetHerHim]#!!\n\nI run to meet my [target.Custom('LoverPetName')], and [target.GetSheHe] throw [target.GetHerselfHimself] in my open arms. The embrace is swift, but sweet as honey. With [target.GetHerHis] hand in mine, I begin to run."
 elope.1001.a: "Hurry, my love! The [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] is waiting!"

 elope.1002.apologetic_relationship.desc: ""My dearest [target.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')], I am so very sorry, but I have to follow my heart. I have left you to marry the love of my life — [owner.Custom2('YourCharacterIntroductionNoComma', ROOT.Char)].""
 elope.1002.unapologetic_relationship.desc: ""I have left to marry [owner.Custom2('YourCharacterIntroductionNoComma', ROOT.Char)]. Do not come after me — I would rather die than be yours again!""
 elope.1002.apologetic_family.desc: ""[ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom2('RelationToMeShort' , SCOPE.sC('target'))|U], I have left to marry the love of my life — [owner.Custom2('YourCharacterIntroductionNoComma', ROOT.Char)]. All I want is to be happy. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.""
 elope.1002.unapologetic_family.desc: ""If you truly loved your own [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort' , target)], you would have wanted me to be happy. But as you care so little for me, I have left to follow my heart. I will marry [owner.Custom2('YourCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] and there is nothing you can do to stop me!""
 elope.1002.a.fallback: "How could [target.GetSheHe]?"

The captain of the guard tells me [owner.Custom2('YourCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] was scheming to steal [target.GetHerHim] away and marry [target.GetHerHim] in secret.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, letters found in [target.Custom('FirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip')] chambers indicate [target.GetSheHe] was in on the whole thing!"
 elope.1012.a: "That [owner.Custom('InsultAdjective')] [owner.Custom('InsultNounSexual')] will never have my [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom2('RelationToMeShort' , SCOPE.sC('target'))]!"
