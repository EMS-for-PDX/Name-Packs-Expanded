 learn_language_outcome.1000.desc: "After lots of hard work I've finally learned the [scheme.GetTarget.GetCulture.GetLanguage.GetName] language! Endless hours practicing accentuation, sleepless nights mimicking inflection, countless lessons mastering intonation... it was all worth it in the end.\n\nDuring my efforts I looked to emulate [target.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] accent — I am sure that [target.GetSheHe] would be impressed with my results!\n\nAnd, of course, [target.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] peasants now respect me a great deal more."
 learn_language_outcome.1000.a: "I feel accomplished!"
 learn_language_outcome.1000.b: "Perhaps I should send a letter in [scheme.GetTarget.GetCulture.GetLanguage.GetNameNoTooltip] to [target.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]?"

 learn_language_outcome.1001.b: "Hah! [owner.GetHerHis|U] vain attempt at gaining glory is laughable!"

 learn_language_outcome.2000.desc: "After lots of hard work... nothing! It is #EMP impossible#! to learn the [scheme.GetTarget.GetCulture.GetLanguage.GetName] language.

 learn_language_outcome.3000.desc: "Unfortunately [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is not around anymore. It is a shame, I was looking to [target.GetHerHim] for how to pitch my accent while learning [target.GetCulture.GetLanguage.GetName].\n\nThat said, no need to cut my studies short — I just need to find someone else to emulate!"

 learn_language_outcome.3000.b: "Perhaps [potential_continuation_target_2.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')]? [potential_continuation_target_2.GetHerHis|U] dialect is interesting."
 learn_language_outcome.3000.c: "Maybe [potential_continuation_target_3.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')]?"
 learn_language_outcome.3000.d: "Ah, I was looking for a reason to stop studying! Hooray!"
