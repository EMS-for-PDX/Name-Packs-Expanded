 befriend_ongoing_rival.0001.desc: "I carefully weighed each word as I wrote the letter to [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')]. Not even when I laid the quill down and went to my chambers could I stop thinking about phrases and hidden meanings that might give offense.\n\nI had high hopes of my letter becoming a turning point in my efforts, but I was gravely mistaken. Today the message was returned unopened!"

 befriend_ongoing_rival.0002.desc: "I have spent enough time in [target.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] vicinity to know [target.GetSheHe] can talk about [target.Custom('herhis_subject_of_interest')] for hours. I did my research and prepared a handful of questions for what I hoped would be a fruitful discussion.\n\nAlas, I was terribly mistaken. Within minutes we found something to disagree upon and were caught up in a frenzied screaming contest."
 befriend_ongoing_rival_0002.a: "I'll swallow my pride and support [target.GetHerHis] standpoint."
 befriend_ongoing_rival_0002.b: "If I only I could make [target.GetHerHim] understand..."

 befriend_ongoing_rival_0003.a: "There might be some hope for us, after all."
 befriend_ongoing_rival.0004.t: "Befriend: A Foolish Mistake"
 befriend_ongoing_rival.0004.desc: "I desperately tried to explain my opinion in a way which would make sense from [target.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] point of view, but I only ended up entangling myself in my own arguments. \n\nThis gave [target.GetHerHim] plenty of angles to attack me from, and I came out of the argument looking like a damned fool."
 befriend_ongoing_rival_0004.a: "[target.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')] might have won this time..."

 befriend_ongoing_rival.0005.desc: "When [spymaster.Custom('TitledFirstName')] informed me of the foul rumor about myself circulating at court, I could feel the heat rising in my veins. I had [spymaster.GetHerHim] investigate its source, and to no great surprise, it seems like the guilty culprit was none other than [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')]. \n\n[ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], why won't that lying [target.Custom('InsultNoun')] stop this nonsense?!"

 befriend_ongoing_rival.2000.desc: "I always seem to be focusing on [target.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] negative sides which is rather unproductive with my current goal in mind.
