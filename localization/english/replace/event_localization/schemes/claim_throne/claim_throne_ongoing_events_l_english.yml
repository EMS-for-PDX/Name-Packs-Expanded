 # Target is followed by ill omens
 claim_throne_ongoing.1001.t: "Ill Omens"
 claim_throne_ongoing.1001.desc: "I clearly do not stand alone in my ambition to rule [target_title.GetNameNoTooltip]! Ravens have been gathering on the roofs of [target.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] [target.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')], and a few nights ago even the stars seemed to be falling, all over [target_title.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip].\n\nPeasants and nobles alike whisper that it is a sign that [target.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] has lost the favor of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm]."
 claim_throne_ongoing.1001.a: "It is time for a new [target.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')]!"
 claim_throne_ongoing.1001.b: "Only the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.AltPriestTermPlural] can interpret these signs."
 # Gradually take on more responsibility in the realm
 claim_throne_ongoing.1002.t: "Earned Authority"
 claim_throne_ongoing.1002.desc: "My pursuit of the [target_title.GetName] is not driven by a mere lust for power, but because I am the only one who can bear the enormous responsibility! Even [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] seems to acknowledge this, as [target.GetSheHe] grants me increasingly important tasks in service of the realm.\n\nSoon I might as well be ruling the [target_title.GetTierAsNameNoTooltip] in all but name..."
 claim_throne_ongoing.1002.a: ""Not to worry, my liege, I will take care of this as well...""
 claim_throne_ongoing.1002.b: "This is all getting a bit much, actually."
 # Buying support from vassals
 claim_throne_ongoing.1003.t: "Earning Support"
 claim_throne_ongoing.1003.desc: "I am quite aware that if I were to serve as [target.GetTitleAsName] of [target_title.GetNameNoTier], I require the support of my now-fellow vassals more than [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] currently has.\n\nIllustrating how generous I would be as [target.GetTitleAsName] could go a long way."
 claim_throne_ongoing.1003.a: "Nothing can be too good for my future servants!"
 claim_throne_ongoing.1003.b: "I will need all my gold for the coming struggle."
 # Lunatic declares themselves ruler
 claim_throne_ongoing.1004.t: "Declaration of Rulership"
 claim_throne_ongoing.1004.desc: "It might seem as if I have to work to claim rulership over the [target_title.GetName], but I already hold a title of far greater authority.\n\nI am the [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U] of All Radishes in [target_title.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]!"
 claim_throne_ongoing.1004.a: "Castellan, fetch me my radish-seal!"
 claim_throne_ongoing.1004.b: "No, not [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord] of all Radishes in [target_title.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]..."
 claim_throne_ongoing.1004.b_flavor: "...but in the world!"

 claim_throne_ongoing.1005.t: "[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U] of the Radishes"
 claim_throne_ongoing.1005.desc: "I have had several servants punished for what I thought was a mockery, as they referred to me as "Your Radishness", but now my Chancellor has shown me the writ I had drawn up insisting on it.\n\nIt feels like a cruel joke the world is playing on me, but at the same time there is a vague memory stirring in the foggy parts of my mind..."
 claim_throne_ongoing.1005.a: "What... what have I been doing?"
 claim_throne_ongoing.1005.b: "I do not make mistakes. You will all follow the writ."

 claim_throne_ongoing.1006.t: "Staunch Support"
 claim_throne_ongoing.1006.desc: "As with so many other things, my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('friend'))], [friend.Custom('TitledFirstName')], sees eye to eye with me on the matter that [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is not fit to rule [target_title.GetNameNoTier].\n\n"I can think of far better candidates," [friend.GetSheHe] lets me know in confidence. "And you stand first among them. Give the word, and you have my support.""
 claim_throne_ongoing.1006.a: "Friendship is the most honorable form of loyalty."
 claim_throne_ongoing.1006.b: "Spend your efforts letting others know how suitable I am."

 claim_throne_ongoing.1007.t: "Rule of the Sword"
 claim_throne_ongoing.1007.desc: "Word of my ambition to take control of [target_title.GetNameNoTier] has started to spread among the [GetPlayer.Custom( 'KnightCulturePluralNoTooltipLowercase' )] of the realm. Discontent rises within the rank and file as many believe it is time for a change.\n\nAs this tension seethes, I am approached by none other than [scheming_knight.Custom('TitledFirstName')], one of [target.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] [GetPlayer.Custom( 'KnightCulturePluralNoTooltipLowercase' )]. "Our warriors deserve better than this. Promise fair treatment to our men, as well as a generous purse of gold, and you will have my sword.""
 claim_throne_ongoing.1007.a: "My $knight_culture_player_plural_no_tooltip_lowercase$ will always come first! "
 claim_throne_ongoing.1007.b: "A $knight_culture_player_no_tooltip_lowercase$ who betrays their liege is no $knight_culture_player_no_tooltip_lowercase$ at all."

 claim_throne_ongoing.1008.t: "Fool Them All"
 claim_throne_ongoing.1008.desc: "My efforts to bolster my claim on [target_title.GetName] could perhaps be aided by some trickery.\n\nA letter proclaiming that the end is nigh has been circulating through neighboring realms as of late. With a bit of forgery and patience, I'm sure I could craft a similar letter proclaiming that I should rule instead of [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')].\n\nBut how should I use such a letter?"
 claim_throne_ongoing.1008.a: "Put on a public display."
 claim_throne_ongoing.1008.b: "Share it with my fellow vassals."
 claim_throne_ongoing.1008.c: "Stay out of it."
 claim_throne_ongoing.1008.c.tt: "You use the time more wisely instead."

 claim_throne_ongoing.1009.t: "Caught in a Lie"
 claim_throne_ongoing.1009.desc: "It seems like [fraud_catcher.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is trying to make a name for [fraud_catcher.GetHerselfHimself] by claiming my recent letter is a mere forgery and that none of the claims within are true.\n\nAnd even worse, [target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is believing every word of it! Have I been found out?"
 claim_throne_ongoing.1009.a: "This was a test, and you all failed."
 claim_throne_ongoing.1009.b: "How dare you accuse me of lying?"
 claim_throne_ongoing.1009.b.duel_success: "You make a convincing case"
 tooltip.claim_throne_ongoing.1009.b.duel_success: "They are all duped"
 claim_throne_ongoing.1009.b.duel_failure: "Nobody buys it"
 tooltip.claim_throne_ongoing.1009.b.duel_failure: "You fail to impress anyone"
