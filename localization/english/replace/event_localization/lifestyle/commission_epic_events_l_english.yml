 commission_epic.9002.conclusion: "\n\nIt has high drama, moral quandaries and tense duels. Everything my family has been forged from is in there! Even the part with the [ROOT.Char.Custom('CompositionDetail')], seemingly so far-fetched, has become a touching moment outlining the destiny of my House!"

 commission_epic.9102.desc: "[composer.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has proven [composer.GetHerselfHimself] far more capable than I would expect from a simple servant. Had I not known better, I might have thought [composer.GetHerHim] from a lineage of poets!\n\nAfter all the time we have spent together, it seems strange that [composer.GetSheHe] should return to shoveling dirt, or whatever it was [composer.GetSheHe] used to."
 commission_epic.9102.a: "[composer.GetSheHe|U] should go out into the world."
 commission_epic.9102.a.flavor: "Let [composer.GetSheHe] see if [composer.GetSheHe] can make something of [composer.GetHerselfHimself]"

 commission_epic.9103.a: "You will continue to serve me honorably."

 commission_epic.9104.desc: "After all the time [composer.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has spent at my court, and how well [composer.GetSheHe] has gotten to know me, it feels strange that [composer.GetSheHe] is not here to see the reception of [composer.GetHerHis] work.\n\nLearned people and children alike are [ROOT.Char.Custom('CompositionTypeActionPP')] it, and even I find it to be an inspiration."
 commission_epic.9104.a: "At least [composer.GetSheHe] is not gone for good!"
 commission_epic.9104.b: "Such is life, sometimes."
 commission_epic.9104.b.flavor: "[ROOT.Char.Custom('CompositionTypeActionPP')|U] the story, I have to wonder. Did [composer.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] know this was how it would end?"

 commission_epic.9999.murdered_by_me: "Considering the drastic measures I had to take towards [composer.Custom('TitledFirstName')], it seems as if [composer.GetSheHe] was never truly a good fit to compose my family epic after all.\n\nThankfully my [ROOT.Char.Custom('CommissionEpicScribes')] are quite capable of doing it by themselves."
