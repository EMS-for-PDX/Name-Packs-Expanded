 diplomacy_generic.0012.t: "Social Manipulation"
 diplomacy_generic.0012.start.desc: "The first time it happened, I barely even gave it a moment's thought, but [disobedient_subject.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] has grown bolder. [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis|U] challenges no longer pass unnoticed"
 diplomacy_generic.0012.council.desc: "at the council table."
 diplomacy_generic.0012.vassal.desc: "among my vassals."
 diplomacy_generic.0012.end.desc: "\n\n[disobedient_subject.GetSheHe|U] is testing my limits. The others are sure to follow — unless I give [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] a taste of [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] own medicine..."
 diplomacy_generic.0012.a: "I will ignore [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] and steal [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] ideas."
 make_invisible_option.tt: "You guess [disobedient_subject.Custom('FirstName')] is unassertive, lethargic, or unambitious"
 diplomacy_generic.0012.b: "Mocking [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] [disobedient_subject.Custom('PointOfRidicule')] will shut [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] up."
 ridicule_option.tt: "You guess [disobedient_subject.Custom('FirstName')] is self-conscious and cares about what others think"
 diplomacy_generic.0012.c: ""Forgetting" to invite [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] leaves [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] in the dark."
 withhold_information_option.tt: "You guess [disobedient_subject.Custom('FirstName')] is weak-minded or keeps to [disobedient_subject.GetHerselfHimself]"
 diplomacy_generic.0012.d: "[disobedient_subject.GetSheHe|U] shall have tasks which are impossible to complete."
 impossible_task_option.tt: "You guess [disobedient_subject.Custom('FirstName')] would do everything in [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] power to get the task done"
 diplomacy_generic.0012.e: "All problems will be blamed on [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim]."
 shame_option.tt: "You guess [disobedient_subject.Custom('FirstName')] is conscientious, or at least wants people to think well of [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim]"
 diplomacy_generic.0012.f: "Commenting on [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] [disobedient_subject.Custom('ObjectifiedFeature')] will throw [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] off."
 objectification_option.tt: "You guess [disobedient_subject.Custom('FirstName')] has often been objectified due to [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] appearance"
 diplomacy_generic.0012.g: "A "subtle" threat of violence will put an end to this."
 threat_option.tt: "You guess [disobedient_subject.Custom('FirstName')] is cowardly or wants to keep the peace"
 diplomacy_generic.0012.h: ""How dare you challenge your #EMP [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')]#!!?""
 diplomacy_generic.0012.tt: "Not very diplomatic, but effective nonetheless..."
 
 diplomacy_generic.0012.good_outcome.desc: "You manipulate [disobedient_subject.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')]"
 diplomacy_generic.0012.bad_outcome.desc: "[disobedient_subject.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')] is not fooled"
 diplomacy_generic.0012.terrible_outcome.desc: "[disobedient_subject.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')] outwits you"
 diplomacy_generic.0012.failure.desc: "You failed to manipulate [disobedient_subject.Custom('TitledFirstName')]"

 diplomacy_generic.0013.t: "Puppet on a String"
 diplomacy_generic.0013.make_invisible.desc: "It seems as if my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('suppressor'))] [suppressor.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has lost interest in my opinion. When I speak up, [suppressor.GetSheHe] interrupts me or shifts [suppressor.GetHerHis] attention to something else. But sometimes, it appears [suppressor.GetSheHe] does listen, for [suppressor.GetSheHe] repeats my ideas and claims them as [suppressor.GetHerHis] own..."
 diplomacy_generic.0013.ridicule.desc: "What do I have to do to be taken seriously by my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('suppressor'))]? Whenever I speak, [suppressor.Custom('TitledFirstName')] interrupts me to mock my ideas or my "[disobedient_subject.Custom('PointOfRidicule')].""
 diplomacy_generic.0013.withhold_information.desc: "Lately, everyone seems to be in the know but me! I look like a right fool when I constantly have to ask [suppressor.Custom('TitledFirstName')] for clarifications in meetings or when I base suggestions on old information. I fear my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('suppressor'))] is deliberately keeping things from me."
 diplomacy_generic.0013.impossible_task.desc: "My [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('suppressor'))], [suppressor.Custom('TitledFirstName')], keeps giving me tasks which are impossible to complete in time! When I try to do them thoroughly I am lazy, and when I hurry [suppressor.GetSheHe] thinks me sloppy."
 diplomacy_generic.0013.shame.desc: "Whenever there is a problem, [suppressor.Custom('TitledFirstName')] seems to think I am the one to blame. However, when I am the one to bring up issues, [suppressor.GetSheHe] accuses me of putting focus on the wrong things!"
 diplomacy_generic.0013.objectification.desc: "When my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('suppressor'))] calls to a meeting, I get a sinking feeling in my stomach. Over the last few weeks, there has been more than one comment regarding my "[disobedient_subject.Custom('ObjectifiedFeature')]", and when I speak [suppressor.GetSheHe] spends more time ogling than listening. Why does [suppressor.Custom('TitledFirstName')] care more about my physical body than what I do and say?"
 diplomacy_generic.0013.threat.desc: "Lately, I have noticed this strange look upon [suppressor.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] face whenever I speak, a combination of exasperation and anger. Yet, I did not know for sure that something was amiss until today. When I disagreed with [suppressor.GetHerHim] in a meeting, [suppressor.GetSheHe] threatened to have me flogged!"
 diplomacy_generic.0013.a: "Two can play this game."
 diplomacy_generic.0013.a.success.tt: "You successfully manipulate [suppressor.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')]"
 diplomacy_generic.0013.a.failure.tt: "You are manipulated by [suppressor.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')]"
 diplomacy_generic.0013.b: "Perhaps I deserve this treatment..."

 diplomacy_generic.0014.t: "$diplomacy_generic.0012.t$: Master of Suppression"
 diplomacy_generic.0014.make_invisible.desc: "Whenever [disobedient_subject.Custom('TitledFirstName')] have raised [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] voice to speak, I have yawned, turned my attention somewhere else, or outright interrupted [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim]. As the others began to follow my example, [disobedient_subject.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')] grew more and more hesitant."
 diplomacy_generic.0014.ridicule.desc: "My constant snide comments about [disobedient_subject.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] [disobedient_subject.Custom('PointOfRidicule')] really seems to have gotten to [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim]! Since the others began to follow my example, [disobedient_subject.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')] has grown more and more hesitant."
 diplomacy_generic.0014.withhold_information.desc: "Since I began to withhold information from [disobedient_subject.Custom('TitledFirstName')], [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe] has made a damn fool of [disobedient_subject.GetHerselfHimself] on more occasions than I can count. Dismissing [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] hopelessly outdated suggestions has been easier than outwitting a dog."
 diplomacy_generic.0014.impossible_task.desc: "When [disobedient_subject.Custom('TitledFirstName')] tried to complete [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] tasks thoroughly, I scolded [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] in front of everyone, and when [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe] hurried to get done in time, I displayed [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] sloppy work for all to see. [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe|U] bent [disobedient_subject.GetHerselfHimself] backwards to please me, yet I never acknowledged [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] efforts."
 diplomacy_generic.0014.shame.desc: "The issue [disobedient_subject.Custom('TitledFirstName')] brought up used to make me look bad, but now the tables have turned. Every time [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe] has raised a subject of concern I have skillfully shifted the blame back to [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim], or made [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] seem petty for even bringing it up."
 diplomacy_generic.0014.objectification.desc: "Lewd jokes, lingering looks, interrupting [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] to "compliment" [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] [disobedient_subject.Custom('ObjectifiedFeature')]. Little by little, I have broken [disobedient_subject.Custom('TitledFirstName')] down, rendering [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] tense and self-conscious."
 diplomacy_generic.0014.threat.desc: "Sometimes, a simple threat of violence does the trick."
 diplomacy_generic.0014.end.desc: "Now [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe] remains quiet, eyes cast low."
 diplomacy_generic.0014.a.cruel: "[disobedient_subject.GetSheHe|U] will think twice before challenging me again!"
 diplomacy_generic.0014.a.compassionate: "Cruel, perhaps, but it had to be done."

 diplomacy_generic.0015.t: "$diplomacy_generic.0012.t$: From Puppeteer to Puppet"
 diplomacy_generic.0015.make_invisible.desc: "When [disobedient_subject.Custom('TitledFirstName')] raised [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] voice to speak, I yawned and turned my attention to my papers. I expected the others to follow my lead, but instead they engaged in the conversation. When I finally swallowed my pride to join in, [disobedient_subject.Custom('FirstName')] already had the upper hand and my words were soon forgotten."
 diplomacy_generic.0015.ridicule.desc: "As it turns out, [disobedient_subject.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] wit is far sharper than I had anticipated. As I commented on [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] [disobedient_subject.Custom('PointOfRidicule')], [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe] immediately turned the situation around and made me look petty for answering to a genuine problem with a snide remark."
 diplomacy_generic.0015.impossible_task.desc: "To my great surprise, [disobedient_subject.Custom('TitledFirstName')] had managed to enlist one of the others to help [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] out with the task I had assigned [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim]. As they barely had time to finish it properly together, it became apparent I had asked for too much. I could not even complain about the execution."
 diplomacy_generic.0015.shame.desc: "Shifting the blame to [disobedient_subject.Custom('TitledFirstName')] turned out to be harder than I had imagined. Yes, I can be convincing, but it turns out [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe] is even more skilled at this game than I. With a single sentence, [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe] tore my explanation to shreds, making me look either stupid or untrustworthy. I am not sure which is worse."
 diplomacy_generic.0015.objectification.desc: "I had thought my lewd comments would shut [disobedient_subject.Custom('TitledFirstName')] up, but [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] response was worthy, yet pointed. Now the other thinks [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe] is some kind of saint, while I seemed both trivial and immoral in comparison."
 diplomacy_generic.0015.threat.desc: "I had thought my threats would shut [disobedient_subject.Custom('TitledFirstName')] up, but [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe] simply ignored it and continued. [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis|U] utter lack of fear made my words seem trivial, rather than intimidating."
 diplomacy_generic.0015.withhold_information.desc: "Even though I regularly have "forgotten" to send [disobedient_subject.Custom('TitledFirstName')] messages or invite [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] to meetings, [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe] always seem to be in the know. Now I look confused and incompetent in comparison!"
 diplomacy_generic.0015.a: "You win this time, [disobedient_subject.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]."
