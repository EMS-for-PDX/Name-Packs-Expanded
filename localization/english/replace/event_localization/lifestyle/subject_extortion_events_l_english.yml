 # Extort a Powerful Vassal, by Petter Vilberg
 subject_extortion.0001.t: "Extort Subjects: Powerful Vassal"
 subject_extortion.0001.desc: "My [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('extortion_target'))], [extortion_target.Custom('TitledFirstName')] — now there is a [extortion_target.GetWomanMan] of means. Judging by [extortion.GetHerHis] expression, [extortion_target.GetSheHe] already knows for what purpose I am approaching [extortion_target.GetHerHim].\n\n"I am loyal, I pay my dues," [extortion_target.GetSheHe] insists. "How can you ask more of me?""
 subject_extortion.0001.a: "Consider it an extra little test of loyalty!"
 subject_extortion.0001.b: "Do not worry, I will have #EMP everyone#! pay."
 subject_extortion.0001.c: "Oh, but you do still owe me, remember?"
 subject_extortion.0001.d: "I am merely joking, [extortion_target.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]!"
 subject_extortion.0001.d.flavor: "[extortion_target.GetSheHe|U] seems more upset than I expected."

 # Extort a County, by Petter Vilberg
 subject_extortion.0002.t: "Extort Subjects: Peasants"
 subject_extortion.0002.desc: "The peasants of the [extortion_target.GetName] seem to be doing better than one might expect from the taxes I have collected there. An extra contribution to my treasury should do no harm.\n\nOh, they will complain, but is that not what peasants always do? They will live through this, I am sure of it."
 subject_extortion.0002.a: "They can do whatever they please, as long as I get my gold!"
 subject_extortion.0002.b: "Why are they never grateful for what they #EMP do#! have?"
 subject_extortion.0002.c: "It is not worth upsetting them right now."

 # Extort Theocratic Vassals, by Petter Vilberg
 subject_extortion.0003.t: "Extort Subjects: [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.AltPriestTermPlural|U]"
 subject_extortion.0003.desc: "Would [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.WealthGodName] not want me to prosper? And would not a well-stocked treasury be the best means for that?\n\nFor some reason, the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.AltPriestTermPlural] is reluctant to agree. They seem to think that the sway they hold over their congregations will protect them."
 subject_extortion.0003.a: "[ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PriestNeuterPlural|U] must contribute as much as anyone else!"
 subject_extortion.0003.b: "Have I not earned this, by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]?"
 subject_extortion.0003.c: "It is a bad idea to upset servants of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate]..."

 # Extort all Vassals, by Petter Vilberg
 subject_extortion.0004.t: "Extort Subjects: Vassals"
 subject_extortion.0004.desc: "The very purpose of my vassals is to support my efforts. While they already pay taxes for the privilege, I cannot help but think of how much more I would earn if they all chipped in just a little more...\n\nGreat wealth for me, at barely any cost to them!"
 subject_extortion.0004.a: "What a perfect solution!"
 subject_extortion.0004.b: "Why take a little, when I can take #EMP a lot#!?"
 subject_extortion.0004.c: "No, their obligations are already fulfilled."

 # Extort Courtiers, by Petter Vilberg
 subject_extortion.0005.t: "Extort Subjects: Courtiers"
 subject_extortion.0005.desc: "My courtiers practically live off of my generosity. Is it not high time they showed their gratitude?\n\nEven a lesser noble must understand that much about honor and duty."
 subject_extortion.0005.a: "They even #EMP live#! by my mercy alone!"
 subject_extortion.0005.b: "This is not a demand, but I do expect gifts."
 subject_extortion.0005.c: "Oh, they already have so little in this world..."

 # Failed to find an extortion target, by Petter Vilberg
 subject_extortion.9998.t: "Extort Subjects"
 subject_extortion.9998.desc.steward: "My [steward.GetCouncilTitle] seems to have failed to find any more sources of gold in my realm.\n\n"I apologize, my liege, but there is nothing left we can get away with taking.""
 subject_extortion.9998.desc: "Despite my grace and honorable character, I seem unable to find anyone who is willing to support me more than my law obliges them to. None of them seem excited about supporting my ideas for new laws, either.\n\nAm I forced to suffer destitution at the hands of my greedy and selfish servants?!"
 subject_extortion.9998.a: "Hold on! What is that clinking in your pocket?"
 subject_extortion.9998.b: "Wait, what is this under my seat?"
