 stewardship_domain.1073.desc: "Most of the commoners living in [target_county.GetName] are of [target_ruler.GetCulture.GetName] descent.

Being anxious to complete the works before next harvest, [baron.GetSheHe] hopes to instead recruit soldiers for labor."

 stewardship_domain.6014.desc: ""You insult me and my entire profession, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]!" The chief mason is not at all pleased with the offers I am willing to make. "In fact, prices are on the rise. Simply the cost of labor, of course. I am sure the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleTierName')] understands.""
 stewardship_domain.6014.a: ""I understand perfectly.""
 stewardship_domain.6014.b: "The [county.GetTierAsNameNoTooltip|l] serves me, and so will the guilds!"

 stewardship_domain.6015.desc: "The chief mason must have enjoyed the company of my [steward.GetCouncilTitle] [steward.Custom('TitledFirstName')], because [steward.GetSheHe] has returned with a deal from the masons that even exceeds my demands."
 stewardship_domain.6015.a: "I could scarce have negotiated better myself!"

 stewardship_domain.6016.desc: "[steward.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has returned to me with an offer from the masons' guild.\n\n"I inspected their records, my liege. I do not believe a better deal can be struck.""
 stewardship_domain.6016.a: "This sounds very good."
 stewardship_domain.6016.b: "Then I was a fool to send you, [steward.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]!"

 stewardship_domain.6017.desc: ""Negotiations did not go... entirely as planned, my liege." My [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('steward'))] sounds apologetic. "However, I do have an offer, even if the mason's guild refuses to speak to me further.""
 stewardship_domain.6017.a: "I have to come to terms with what my servants accomplish."

 stewardship_domain_special.1002.c.tt: "I take the [development_county.GetName] from [county_holder.Custom('TitledFirstName')]"
 
 stewardship_domain_special.1003.desc: ""Thank you for believing in me, [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeAddress', county_holder)]!"\n\n[county_holder.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)|U] has managed to solve the crisis [county_holder.GetSheHe] found [county_holder.GetHerselfHimself] in. Sometimes the best course of action is to trust in the skills of others, and then learn from them!"
 stewardship_domain_special.1003.a: "Tell me all about how you did it!"

 stewardship_domain_special.1004.desc: "The reports from the [development_county.GetName] only grow more disastrous, and it soon becomes evident that [county_holder.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has only made the situation worse."
 stewardship_domain_special.1004.a: "What kind of [county_holder.Custom('TitleTierName')] is [county_holder.GetSheHe]?!"

 stewardship_domain_special.1005.desc: "As I watch the [development_county.GetName] flourish under my guidance I cannot help but feel pride in what I have accomplished. To dabble in lesser management from time to time is a good way to learn!"
 stewardship_domain_special.1005.a: "This knowledge will be useful indeed!"

 stewardship_domain_special.1006.desc: "No matter what I try the [development_county.GetName] cannot find any respite. It is not as badly off as before, but I am at a loss as for how to solve the remaining tasks before me."

 stewardship_domain_special.1103.a: "You have my permission to do this annually from now on."

 stewardship_domain_special.1104.desc_silk: ""My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], what are we supposed to do with all this silk?"\n\nApparently, the demand for silk was not high in the area, and [second_local_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is left with a lot of the expensive cloth unsold."
 stewardship_domain_special.1104.desc_crops: ""My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], the crops are growing stale and moldy, what are we supposed to do with it all?"\n\nApparently, the demand for local crops was not high in the area, and [second_local_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is left with a lot of it unsold."

 stewardship_domain_special.1105.desc: "[local_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] presents me with wares from all over the world; religious objects from holy cities, food grown by the [local_baron.GetFaith.DevoteeMalePlural] and [local_baron.GetFaith.DevoteeFemalePlural] in the area, marvels from foreign religions...\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], what wares should we promote for the new fair?""
 stewardship_domain_special.1105.a: "We will honor local saints by focusing on religious objects!"
 stewardship_domain_special.1105.a.tt: "The people are more likely to appreciate this if their religious fervor is strong"

 stewardship_domain_special.1107.desc_religious_objects: ""My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], what are we supposed to do with these holy trinkets?"\n\nApparently, the holy objects did not attract the pious to the degree I hoped, and [local_baron.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is left with a lot unsold."
 stewardship_domain_special.1107.desc_religious_food: ""My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], what are we supposed to do with all this food?"\n\nApparently, the meals prepared by the [local_baron.GetFaith.DevoteeMalePlural] and [local_baron.GetFaith.DevoteeFemalePlural] of the area would have benefited from some divine intervention — almost nothing got sold."
 stewardship_domain_special.1107.desc_religious_other: ""My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], what are we supposed to do with these blasphemous trinkets?"\n\nThe foreign items only repulsed the people — discouraging them from visiting the market.

 stewardship_domain_special.1107.a: "A tumultuous start, but I'm sure the locals can handle it now!"
