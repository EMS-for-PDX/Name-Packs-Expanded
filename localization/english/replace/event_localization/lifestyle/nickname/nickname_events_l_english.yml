 lifestyle_nicknames.0001.desc: "After spending countless hours poring over ledgers, tallying up numbers and managing the court, my meticulousness has finally paid off. I have made my realm more prosperous than it has ever been!\n\nEvery able ruler, such as I, [ROOT.Char.Custom('FullName')], ought to be known by their achievements.\n\nNow, what should I call myself?"

 lifestyle_nicknames.0002.desc: ""Thy will be done, my liege!" My [my_steward.GetCouncilTitle] cries out as [my_steward.GetSheHe] leaves my chambers.\n\nI get up from the chair and walk out onto the balcony. Below I see thousands, all people brought to prosperity under my rule. What do I want them to remember me by?"

 lifestyle_nicknames.0003.t: "Speech is Silver"
 lifestyle_nicknames.0003.desc: "All the time spent on diplomatic efforts has been paying off. They say silence is golden, but I've found that being able to communicate, argue, and convince, is worth more than gold itself.\n\nEvery respected ruler is known by a second name for their achievements, so how should I be remembered?"

 lifestyle_nicknames.0006.desc: "I look over the battle plans laid out in front of me and take one of the wooden soldiers in hand. As a child I played with them in my chambers, and now I use those same toys for warfare.\n\n"[ROOT.Char.Custom('TitledFirstName')]?" — my [my_marshal.GetCouncilTitle] enters the tent — "The commanders would like to speak with you. How would you like to be introduced?"\n\nMy [my_marshal.GetCouncilTitle] is right in his implication, the men ought to know they fight under someone larger than life."

 lifestyle_nicknames.0006.tt: "You too are but a mortal [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan], and no [epithet|E] will change that."
 
 lifestyle_nicknames.0007.t: "Silence is Golden"
 lifestyle_nicknames.0007.desc: "They say that influence is like grass in spring. It can grow on its own, but I tended mine patiently until it spread across my realm, and then beyond. That garden, that I have tended so laboriously, has blossomed into something truly beautiful.\n\nPower resides where I wish it. The price I pay to keep people silent is high, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. I am a force to be reckoned with, and I should be remembered for the influence I possess!

 lifestyle_nicknames.0008.desc: "A monarch, who can intimidate [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] vassals and inspire [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] people. A ruler loved by [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] subjects, wielding the power to change the fate of the realm. A land, where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.\n\nThese are the values I believe in!

 lifestyle_nicknames.0009.t: "The Pen is Mightier"
 lifestyle_nicknames.0009.desc: "The library in my palace is truly a sight to behold. Thousands of ledgers, books and scrolls, containing knowledge unknown to most.

[my_chaplain.GetCouncilTitle|U] [my_chaplain.Custom('FirstName')] bows deeply at the door to my chambers.\n\nI gather my notes in a stack on my writing desk; I am supposed to hold a speech about recent cultural accomplishments of the realm, in front of emissaries and ambassadors.\n\nMy [my_chaplain.GetCouncilTitle] stops me before we enter the hall:\n"They all know #EMP of#! you, of course — but how would you like me to introduce you?""
 lifestyle_nicknames.0010.a: "Who am I but "$nick_the_sage$?""

 lifestyle_nicknames.0010.tt: "You enter the hall unadorned by a new [nickname|E]."
 
 lifestyle_nicknames.0011.t: "Reverberation"
 lifestyle_nicknames.0011.desc: "No matter where I go, I cannot escape the disapproving gaze of noble and commoner alike. Despite my best intentions, it seems the name I have chosen for myself was met with more contempt than I anticipated.\n\nI retreat to my chambers and ponder what I should do..."
 lifestyle_nicknames.0011.a: "They may not respect me, but they will obey me!"
 lifestyle_nicknames.0011.a.tt: "You let everyone know that you intend to keep your chosen [cognomen|E] and will not have it any other way."

 lifestyle_nicknames.1000.t: "Nickname: [nickname_getter.GetNicknameNoTooltip|U]"
 lifestyle_nicknames.1000.desc: ""My [informer.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('nickname_getter'))], have you heard what they call you?" My [nickname_getter.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('informer'))] [informer.Custom('FirstName')] says to me, while [informer.Custom('quirk_pos_pp')].\n\n"
 lifestyle_nicknames.1000.desc_prison: ""[nickname_getter.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')], have you heard what they call you?" [informer.Custom('FirstName')] sputters, tapping a cup on the iron bars.\n\n"
 lifestyle_nicknames.1000.desc_good: ""They call you #EMP '[nickname_getter.GetTitledFirstNameNicknamedNoTooltip]'#!, spectacular, is it not? It's on the lips of peasant and noble alike.""
 lifestyle_nicknames.1000.desc_bad: ""They call you #EMP '[nickname_getter.GetTitledFirstNameNicknamedNoTooltip]'#!... not what you would call #EMP flattering#! perhaps, but it's unlikely that you can do anything to change it.""
 lifestyle_nicknames.1000.end_bad_bad: "\n\n"Better get used to it!" [informer.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] snickers as [informer.GetSheHe] walks away."
 lifestyle_nicknames.1000.end_good_bad: "\n\n"Not what I'd have chosen for you..." [informer.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] says, visibly frustrated."
 lifestyle_nicknames.1000.end_bad_good: "\n\n"For what it's worth, I promise not to call you by that name." [informer.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] says and smiles."
