For the somber tone [first_lover.Custom('TitledFirstName')] spoke to me in, I cannot help but feel as though [first_lover.GetSheHe] was trying to hurt me.\n\n"I... but I love you!" I forced from my dry throat. My pleas could not change [first_lover.GetHerHis] heart."

 lover.0002.like.vengeful: "As feeble excuses passed [first_lover.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] lips, hatred began to smolder in the pit of my stomach, each word feeding the fire. So, I am not good enough for [first_lover.GetHerHim] anymore, am I? [first_lover.GetSheHe|U] will regret this, mark my words..."
 lover.0002.dislike.vengeful: "As pathetic excuses passed [first_lover.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] lips, icy contempt spread from the pit of my stomach, shattering any remaining tenderness I felt toward [first_lover.GetHerHim]. [first_lover.GetSheHe|U] will regret spurning me like this, mark my words..."
 lover.0002.like.humble: "While the pain [first_lover.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] words caused was nearly impossible to bear, I could not deny their truth. I was never good enough for [first_lover.GetHerHim]. I hope [first_lover.GetSheHe|U] will be happier without me..."
 lover.0002.like.arrogant: "[first_lover.Custom('TitledFirstName')]... did not want me anymore? What [first_lover.GetSheHe] said made no sense. I thought [first_lover.GetSheHe] must have been unwell, or perhaps had been forced to utter those bizarre words. I am... I am perfect for [first_lover.GetHerHim]!"
 lover.0002.dislike.arrogant: "I could barely stop myself from laughing, so absurd were [first_lover.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] words. Of course [first_lover.GetSheHe] still wanted me, I am all [first_lover.GetSheHe] has ever desired! However, I did not argue — the loss is [first_lover.GetHerHis]. I could not care any less."
 lover.0002.like.lustful: "I had missed the touch of [first_lover.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] eager hands, so [first_lover.GetHerHis] unannounced arrival was a delightful surprise. I could not wait to lose myself in [first_lover.GetHerHis] embrace, but when I tried to pull [first_lover.GetHerHim] close [first_lover.GetSheHe] resisted.\n\nI barely remember the words that followed, but the dull ache [first_lover.GetSheHe] left behind has not faded one bit."
 lover.0002.dislike.lustful: "To my surprise, when [first_lover.Custom('TitledFirstName')] told me we were over, my first feeling was that of relief. Finally I could admit [first_lover.GetSheHe] was no longer able to fulfill my desires."
 lover.0002.like.understanding: "Even though [first_lover.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] struggled to find the words, I knew [first_lover.GetHerHim] well enough to tell they would be bad. I suppressed my grief, not wanting to make this any harder for [first_lover.GetHerHim], and gave [first_lover.GetHerHis] hand a gentle squeeze. Then the words spilled out of [first_lover.GetHerHim] like a waterfall and my deepest fear was confirmed."
 lover.0002.dislike.understanding: "Whatever [first_lover.Custom('TitledFirstName')] had come to tell me, it obviously distressed [first_lover.GetHerHim].

 lover.0002.like.angry: "After watching [first_lover.Custom('TitledFirstName')] squirm and sweat for the better part of an hour, [first_lover.GetHerHis] confession came as no surprise. However, I had not expected my own reaction. Vile words spilled like lava from my mouth, I could not stop them, nor did I want to. I had to see my own pain reflected upon [first_lover.Custom('FirstNamePossessive')] face.\n\nThe rage protected me until [first_lover.Custom('FirstName')] stormed out of the room. Then I was left with nothing but the agonizing reality of rejection."
 lover.0002.dislike.angry: "After watching [first_lover.Custom('TitledFirstName')] squirm and sweat for the better part of an hour, I could no longer hold my rage at bay. Every spiteful thing I had ever wanted to say to that wretched [first_lover.GetWomanMan] spilled like lava from my mouth.\n\nThe pain in [first_lover.GetHerHis] eyes made me stronger, and when [first_lover.GetSheHe] finally croaked that we were over, my triumph was complete."
 lover.0002.like.paranoid: "As [first_lover.Custom('TitledFirstName')] told me [first_lover.GetSheHe] did not want me anymore, it came as no surprise. I had seen it in [first_lover.GetHerHis] eyes for the longest time, felt it in the hesitation of [first_lover.GetHerHis] touch. Every time I had asked, [first_lover.GetSheHe] had denied it, but it seems like [first_lover.GetSheHe] was unable to hide it any more. Or perhaps [first_lover.GetSheHe] simply enjoyed watching me suffer..."
 lover.0002.dislike.paranoid: "As [first_lover.Custom('TitledFirstName')] told me [first_lover.GetSheHe] did not want me anymore, it came as no surprise.
