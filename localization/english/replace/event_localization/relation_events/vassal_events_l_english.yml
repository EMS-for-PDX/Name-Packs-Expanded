 vassal.5010.desc: "It is perhaps not my place to question your strategy, yet I wonder why you allow the enemies of our faith to go about their wicked business without interference. We have both the means and the right to deliver [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodNamePossessive] justice upon them, so surely we must do so!"

 vassal.5050.desc: "I would like to petition you, in your wisdom, to consider my claim for the [claim.GetName]. It is not right that [claimed_title_holder.Custom('TitledFirstName')] should sit safely as a usurper in [vassal.GetHerHis] castle, mocking my dynasty's birthright. Please, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], support your loyal vassal by taking up arms if they will not recognize my claim willingly!"

 vassal.5060.desc: "A year has now passed since I made my pledge to [vassal.Custom('TitledFirstName')] of going to war over [vassal.GetHerHis] claim on the [claim.GetName]. [vassal.Custom('TitledFirstName')] will be unhappy about my lack of action on [vassal.GetHerHis] behalf."
 vassal.5060.a: "Perhaps I should not have made such a commitment."
 vassal.5060.b: "But the time is simply not right, you see?"
