 VIETrepublic.0007.desc: "[RP_snob.Custom('TitledFirstName')] introduced me to a wealthy merchant today. Though I have no business with this man at the moment, I find him pleasant, if a little too eager to show off his fine clothes and jewelry.\n\nShortly after he leaves, [RP_snob.Custom('TitledFirstNamePossessive')] previous smile changes into a scowl: "I can't believe I have to work with him. He may be an important business partner, but personally? I detest him. He's nouveau riche, you see, and not from the old patrician families like us. He was just a peddler who happened to get lucky a couple years ago, and is now showing off to everyone, despite his lack of class.""
 
 VIETrepublic.0020.desc: "At a ball hosted by one of the patrician families of the republic, it has come to my attention that many of the people there are dancing a… very strange dance, one I have not seen before. I do not recognize the way the partiers’ move their arms and legs to the music the lute players are playing.\n\n[RP_breakdancer.Custom('TitledFirstName')], who is also there, notices my puzzlement, and laughs, “This dance is the latest fad in town! Everyone is learning it! I’m surprised you've never seen it before.”\n\n“I don't think I can dance this...” I ask.\n\n“Nonsense! It’s not a difficult dance to do, once you learn the basics,” [RP_breakdancer.GetSheHe] tells me. “Come, let me show you how it’s done - it’ll be fun!”"
 
 VIETrepublic.0026.desc: "A few months ago, [RP_loser.Custom('TitledFirstName')] made a very poor decision in supporting a business venture [RP_loser.GetSheHe] knew was a risky investment - so risky, that no one else in the republic would have put their money in it. To no one’s surprise, [RP_loser.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] lost a lot of money. As a result, [RP_loser.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] is understandably very distraught.\n\n“I can’t believe I was that much of an idiot!” [RP_loser.GetSheHe] says. “Now I’ll be the laughingstock of the whole republic!”"
 
 VIETrepublic.0027.desc: "A few months ago, [RP_winner.Custom('TitledFirstName')] decided to throw [RP_winner.GetHerHis] support behind a somewhat risky business venture. Some in the republic said it would not end well, others felt it was a risk worth taking. Anyhow, in the end, [RP_winner.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] ended up making quite a bit of coin from that investment."
 
 VIETrepublic.0036.desc: "I and [RP_calculator.Custom('TitledFirstName')] have recently joined forces to negotiate a business deal together. We are currently looking over the financial documents and calculating various things related to the deal.\n\n"Can you check my calculations?" [RP_calculator.GetSheHe] asks, coming over to where I am sitting, an abacus in  [RP_calculator.GetHerHis] hand. "I feel like I'm missing something here, but the numbers just don't add up."\n\nI take the abacus and perform the calculation myself, with little difficulty, and explain how I did it. Afterwards, [RP_calculator.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] smacks [RP_calculator.GetHerselfHimself] on the head when [RP_calculator.GetSheHe] realizes the problem.\n\n"Ah!" [RP_calculator.GetSheHe] says, taking the abacus back, "Seems like I made an elementary error and didn't double check the numbers there. No wonder I kept getting it wrong with the abacus! Thanks for the help!""
