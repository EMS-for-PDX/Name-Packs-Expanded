 merchant_republic_events.1003.desc: "The votes are in and the ballots have been tallied. Despite our agents' assurances that matters were well in hand, the streets resound with cheers not for our distinguished name, but rather that of [election_winner.Custom('TitledFirstName')]. The perfidious and ungrateful masses have decided, in their infinite wisdom, that the ship of state would be better captained by other hands. Already recreant rats flee the sinking ship, while banners that yesterday proudly flew our favor today bear a very different crest. Very well, then; let the sycophants scurry to curry favor with their new masters; the turn of the pendulum will come again soon enough, and then they will all be reminded in whose hands true power lies. "
 merchant_republic_events.1004.desc: "The votes are in and the ballots have been tallied. The victor's name reassuring in its familiarity, and the jubilation of their supporters as they flood the streets in triumph, banners flying proudly, is gratifying to behold. Henceforth, the reins of power in our great republic shall be held by our very own house's [election_winner.Custom('TitledFirstName')]. This bodes well for the fortunes of our family; let us drink deeply of the well of power while our rivals, denied its tutelary blessings, wither and fade away."
 merchant_republic_events.1005.desc: "The votes are in and the ballots have been tallied. It seems that the vessel of our family's fortunes will continue its placid course, relatively untroubled by the turbulent tides of power, and that this will not be the election that exalts our house to its rightful position at this republic's head. Still, if we have gained nothing with these results, neither have we lost, and with new leadership come new opportunities. Perhaps our new leader, [election_winner.Custom('TitledFirstName')], will prove favorable to our interests."
