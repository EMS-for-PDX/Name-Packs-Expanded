Sometimes, we need more.\n\nI have thus ordered the beekeepers of my realm to provide us more tribute this year than I normally request of them.

Everyone has brought a handful of dirt from their hometowns, which is all placed on an ancient mound which serves as a central place of prayer. The mound has, of course, grown over the years as these kinds of ceremonies are held.\n\nFollowing this, a #italic shtatol#!, a huge candle made from beeswax, is erected in the center of the mound. Then, the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] light the candle, and we afterwards make a number of animal sacrifices to earn the favor of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm], particularly that of a bull, whose meat will later be cooked for everyone to eat."

As I meet various people during ozks, although their mundane lives are not necessarily my concern, I do learn quite a bit from hearing about these issues and how people are trying to solve them."
 mordvin.0037.a: "It is insightful!"
 mordvin.0038.t: "Sports Competitions"
 mordvin.0038.desc: "During major ozks, sports competitions are often held in the spirit of celebration and fun. From wrestling, to archery, to running, and many other sports, it is a wonderful spectacle. There is so much to see, and I find myself having a lot of fun cheering the competitors on."

 mordvin.0043.desc: "Per ancient [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] custom, the giant #italic shtatol#! candle that was erected on the large mound at the center of this Ozks holiday was made thanks to contributions of wax from all of the families involved, from the poorest to the wealthiest.\n\nI, as the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], obviously contributed significant amounts of wax to the making of this candle.\n\nRegardless, the traditional belief is that the larger this candle is, the more prosperous and powerful we are as a community."

The bull, of course, symbolizes longevity and health.\n\nNow that the holiday is well underway, the sacrificed bull has been skinned by specially appointed men, before it is cooked by women assigned the honor to do so. Oftentimes, the bull’s meat is prepared in a soup along with various vegetables and herbs, as it has been this time.\n\nI am eating the bull meat soup now, and I have to say, it tastes quite delicious!"
