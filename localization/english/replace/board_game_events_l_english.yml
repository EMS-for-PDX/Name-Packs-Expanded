 # Opponent Winning
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.diplomacy.low: ""You know," muses my opponent, "I may not be much of a talker, but I'm alarmingly good at [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')].""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.diplomacy.medium: ""Ahhhh, if only public speaking was as easy as beating you at [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')]," remarks my opponent."
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.diplomacy.high: ""I genuinely don't know which is easier," laments my opponent, "beating you at [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')] or telling the tale of your embarrassing loss.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.martial.low: ""If war was as easy as [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')], I'd rule the world by now," laughs my opponent. "But then, that's just me.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.martial.medium: ""Mmmm, you're not much of a strategist, are you?" chortles my opponent."
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.martial.high: ""The battlefield, the board, it's all just a case of that most important thing," warbles my opponent. [bg_opponent.GetSheHe|U] taps [bg_opponent.GetHerHis] forehead with a knuckle for emphasis."
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.stewardship.low: ""I wish matters of coin were as easy as playing [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')]," remarks my opponent. "I'd be swimming in silver.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.stewardship.medium: ""Do you think [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')] is good practice for real administration?" questions my opponent idly. "I've always rather thought so. Not that I'm... implying anything by it.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.stewardship.high: ""I've always said that [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')] can teach a [bg_opponent.GetWomanMan] much about running a realm," pontificates my opponent. "And vice versa, naturally.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.intrigue.low: ""See, this is why I like [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')]," opines my opponent. "No skulking around, no lying, just a fair game of wits. One where, well...""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.intrigue.medium: ""Did you know you can learn #EMP exactly#! how someone lies by watching their [bg_myself.Custom('MaskFace')] during [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')]?" queries my opponent. "Oh, I didn't mean... just a note...""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.intrigue.high: ""Careful," smirks my opponent, "one more move like that and you'll activate my trap [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GamePiece')].""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.learning.low: ""You know, they tell me I need #EMP books#! to prove my smartness," pontificates my opponent, "but I think it's pretty clear right now that I'm not such a lout.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.learning.medium: ""Honestly," waxes my opponent, "I'm impressed you're playing as well as you are, considering who you're up against.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.learning.high: ""I've studied [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')] extensively," explains my opponent, "and I'm sorry to say that by this point I simply don't think there's any way for you to win.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.lustful: ""As both the world's greatest lover #EMP and#! [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')]-player, I don't blame you for losing to me," chortles my opponent."
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.chaste: ""Discipline in the home begets discipline on the board, you know," pontificates my opponent. "A little restraint goes a long way.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.gluttonous: ""I think I might celebrate my win with a feast," muses my opponent. "I feel like something sweet, to go with the victory.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.temperate: ""I may even allow myself a cup of rose-scented water after this game," muses my opponent. "I don't treat myself often, but I think I've earned it.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.greedy: ""The only thing sweeter than clinking gold is the soft pitter-patter of a [bg_myself.GetWomanMan]'s tears against a [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')] board," smiles my opponent. "Don't you agree?""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.generous: ""Look, I may be winning, but if you ask nicely, I'm willing to just... let you have this," explains my opponent, voice dripping with kindness and pity. "There's more to life than winning at [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')].""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.lazy: "My opponent yawns loudly. "I was honestly expecting a bit more of a challenge, [bg_myself.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]. I'm barely even awake.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.diligent: ""This is why you need to put the work in," consoles my opponent, tone #EMP utterly#! insufferable. "There's no substitute for hard-work, in life or in [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')].""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.wrathful: "My opponent is oddly, uncharacteristically calm. "Oh, not much to be mad about," [bg_opponent.GetSheHe] says, catching my gaze, "when things are going so #EMP well#!.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.calm: ""I have always found that the key to [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')] is a clear mind and a cool head," muses my opponent."You'll get that some day.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.patient: ""Most people," lectures my opponent, "don't fully appreciate quite how tricky it is to pull off [bg_opponent.Custom('BG_RandomArticleDirection')] [bg_opponent.Custom('BG_RandomRankPossessive')] [bg_opponent.Custom('BG_RandomMoveType')]. Let alone defend against it.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.impatient: ""You're really rather slow when you play [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')], [bg_myself.Custom2('GetYoungMiddleAgedOld',bg_opponent)] [bg_myself.GetWomanMan]", mutters my opponent, drumming [bg_opponent.GetHerHis] fingers on the board."
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.arrogant: ""Don't feel bad [bg_myself.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]," smarms my opponent, reclining where [bg_opponent.GetSheHe] sits leisurely. "We can't all be this naturally #EMP talented#!""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.humble: ""Honestly, you're doing great," chirps my opponent. "I don't usually do this well, so I think you're just having bad luck.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.deceitful: ""Don't feel too bad," soothes my opponent, voice honey-sweet and caustic as sin." Even [bg_opponent.GetFaith.TricksterGodName] couldn't follow my moves.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.honest: ""My, this is all going #EMP much#! better than I expected!" exclaims my opponent. "You're not a difficult foe at all... oh, sorry, didn't mean to be rude. Just being honest.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.craven: ""I... I'm winning? I'm winning!" cries my opponent. [bg_opponent.GetSheHe|U] seems genuinely surprised, but then, [bg_opponent.GetSheHe] #EMP has#! spent half the match watching through [bg_opponent.GetHerHis] fingers."
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.brave: ""You'll permit me a little chuckle," remarks my opponent. "but you're going to have to play bolder than #EMP that#! to beat #EMP me#!""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.shy: ""All that practice is paying off!" squeaks my opponent, beaming in timid pride at the state of the board."
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.gregarious: ""Don't feel too bad," drawls my opponent, cracking [bg_opponent.GetHerHis] knuckles. "I win at [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')] like I make friends. Alarmingly easily.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.ambitious: ""Do you think they appoint some kind of... #EMP King#! of Games?" queries my opponent, scratching [bg_opponent.GetHerHis] chin. "I feel like I'm working towards that title already, you see.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.content: ""What a lovely game," chortles my opponent. "We couldn't ask for anything better, could we? Besides your luck, I mean.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.arbitrary: ""I'm not generally much of a one for rules," opines my opponent, "but [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')] makes me see the appeal, just a little. They let you #EMP force#! other people admit you're better than them sometimes.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.just: ""Look," explains my opponent, waving a sheaf of papers at me. "I'm sorry you keep trying to make illegal moves, but if you'd #EMP read the rules#!, you'd be doing better.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.cynical: ""Naturally, I'm not taking it easy on you," leers my opponent. "You #EMP definitely#! wouldn't on me, so why bother?""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.zealous: ""I wish I could take credit for this sure-victory," lazes my opponent, "but it's all the work of [bg_opponent.GetFaith.KnowledgeGodName] #EMP through#! me.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.paranoid: ""I know you've still got some trick up your sleeve," scowls my opponent. "No one can possibly be #EMP this#! easy to beat.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.trusting: ""I might just nip to the privy whilst it's your move," smiles my opponent. "Don't go fiddling with my [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GamePiecePlural')]!""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.compassionate: ""I'm sorry if I'm putting you in a bad move, [bg_myself.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]," says my opponent, [bg_opponent.GetHerHis] voice genuinely remorseful. "I play [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')] for fun, but I think it's fun when we're #EMP both#! enjoying it.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.callous: ""By [bg_opponent.GetFaith.HouseholdGodName], you don't put up much of a fight, do you?" exclaims my opponent bluntly."
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.sadistic: ""It's #EMP so#! much more fun to toy with a wounded foe," drawls my opponent with no small amount of delighted venom, "don't you agree, [bg_myself.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]?""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.stubborn: ""Quite nice to have such an easy win for a change," scoffs my opponent. "Usually I have to argue for a few hours before the other player admits I won.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.fickle: ""I really love that, no matter what strategy I settle on, you always lose just as hard," quips my opponent."
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.vengeful: ""Of course, this is all just payback," hisses my opponent. "And you know #EMP damned#! well what for.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.forgiving: ""To be frank, I was expecting a bit more of a challenge," whines my opponent. "It's alright, though. At least you're good practice.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.rowdy: "My little opponent chants, or at least slurs, a number of ill-planned threats at me, all but knocking the board away in [bg_opponent.GetHerHis] excitement."
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.charming: ""We should play [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')] every day [bg_myself.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]," chirrups my little opponent. "It's always such fun!""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.curious: ""You know," ponders my little opponent, "I'm really learning a lot from beating you.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.pensive: ""I've read so much about how to play [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')]," beams my little opponent, "but I didn't know how easy it'd be to #EMP apply#! it!""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.bossy: ""After I beat you," pronounces my little opponent, "I want a sweet roll. As tribute.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.relation.friend: ""Cheer up, sour-[bg_myself.Custom('MaskFace')]," laughs my opponent. "It's just a little game between friends, right?""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.relation.best_friend: ""For what it's worth, win or lose," says my best friend, "there's no one in the world I'd rather play [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')] with.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.relation.rival: ""By [bg_opponent.GetFaith.FateGodName], you're as bad at [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')] as you are at ruling!" cackles my rival."
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.relation.nemesis: "My nemesis says nothing. [bg_opponent.GetSheHe|U] simply stares at me, [bg_opponent.Custom('EyeEyes')] burning with pure, unrefined #EMP hate#!."
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.relation.lover: "Without breaking eye contact with me, my lover begins to gently caress one of the [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GamePiecePlural')] with [bg_opponent.GetHerHis] fingertip and... Oh. #EMP Oh my#!"
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.relation.soulmate: "My soulmate is only half paying attention to our game of [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')]. Mostly, [bg_opponent.GetSheHe] seems focused on staring deep into my [bg_myself.Custom('EyeEyes')]."
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.relation.bully: ""See?" giggles my opponent, "this is why I hit you. You're just #EMP such#! a loser.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.relation.victim: "My victim's eyes are alight with righteous fury, happy that, for once, something is going #EMP [bg_opponent.GetHerHis]#! way."
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.relation.crush: "Wait, did [bg_opponent.GetSheHe] say something? I think [bg_opponent.GetSheHe] said something! Oh crumbs, sometimes I just get a little lost looking at [bg_opponent.GetHerHim] and now I've ruined things."
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.relation.guardian: ""Watch me closely [bg_myself.Custom('FirstName')]," says my guardian. "Study how I play and you might just learn something.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.relation.ward: "My ward beams a smile at me. "Can we play [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')] more often? #EMP Please#!!""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.hook_on.weak: ""$board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.hook_on.strong$""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.hook_on.strong: ""It feels good to turn the tables on you, you know," says my opponent. "Always seems like you've got me under your thumb. Unless we're playing [SCOPE.Custom('BG_GameType')], of course.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.hooked_by.weak: ""$board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.hooked_by.strong$""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.hooked_by.strong: ""You're not throwing this deliberately because of our #EMP agreement#! are you?" queries my opponent, scratching [bg_opponent.GetHerHis] chin thoughtfully. "Because you play like you're trying to lose.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.match_history.recently_won_against.default: ""Ahhh, how many times have I beaten you, now?" chuckles my opponent. "I #EMP honestly#! lose count.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.match_history.recently_won_against.county: ""[bg_myself.MakeScope.Var('bg_recent_land_loss_stake').Title.GetNameNoTier] is doing well you know," drawls my opponent, "#EMP much#! better since I took over the place.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.match_history.recently_won_against.gamble: ""Another match," notes my opponent, "another win for my tally. You're going to bankrupt yourself, you know.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.match_history.recently_lost_against.default: ""Now this," titters my opponent, "is #EMP much#! better than that #EMP other#! match we played.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.match_history.recently_lost_against.county: ""After [bg_opponent.MakeScope.Var('bg_recent_land_loss_stake').Title.GetNameNoTier], I can't beat you enough," grumbles my opponent, still sore after our old bet."
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.match_history.recently_lost_against.gamble: ""Looks like the bet's going my way this time, doesn't it?" chortles my opponent."
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.other.pro_gamer: ""You should really pay close attention to my techniques," smarms my opponent. "I'm about to do what's called a pro-board gamer move.""
 board_games.0001.desc.opponent_winning.other.avlf: ""#EMP You're#! a game master? Don't flatter yourself, [bg_myself.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')]. You're not even a player.""

 # Player Winning
 board_games.0001.desc.i_am_winning.diplomacy.low: ""I don't... I can't... Just ease up on me!" all-but-screams my opponent, clearly frustrated and unable to find the right words."
 board_games.0001.desc.i_am_winning.diplomacy.medium: "My opponent says nothing, simply drumming [bg_opponent.GetHerHis] fingers against the table in a fit of pique."
 board_games.0001.desc.i_am_winning.diplomacy.high: ""It would seem," snarks my opponent, "that you have me at a slight disadvantage. For now.""
