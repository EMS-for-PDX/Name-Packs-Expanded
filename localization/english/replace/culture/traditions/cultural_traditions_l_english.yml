 culture_tradition_events.0100.desc: "A missive from [head_of_faith.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has arrived. It starts off with pleasantries, and outlines the importance I hold in the eyes of the [culture_scope.GetName] people.\n\n"

 culture_tradition_events.0101.desc: "It's rare enough for me to get a chance for a quiet meal without sycophants or matters of state interrupting, but tonight I've managed it. A nice, calm dinner, and a chance to rest my social muscles.\n\nWithin seconds, the door bursts off its hinges with a tragic inevitability, and a [mendicant_mystic.GetFaith.PriestNeuter] barges into the room. [mendicant_mystic.GetSheHe|U] carries gnarled-walking stick, still covered in splinters from battering down the door in a single swing.\n\n"Noble [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')], I come with an offer!

Straight. Hours.#!\n\nAt long last, the [mendicant_mystic.GetWomanMan] falls silent, looking at me for a response. I feel my eye begin to twitch."
