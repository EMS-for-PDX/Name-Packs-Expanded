Several of Socotra's mechanics even revolve around the Bawarij. For example, [rulers|E] of the [county|E] of Socotra can take a [decision|E] to Recruit Bawarij Outlaws during a war, bolstering their armies at the cost of a devastating negative [county_modifier|E]. They can also take a [decision|E] to form the [kingdom|E] of Socotra if they have upgraded their Bawarij Den to an appropriate level.\n\nLastly, Bawarij Pirates may sometimes appear as [courtiers|E] via events.

 building_type_RICE_pirate_den_01: "Indian Ocean Pirate Den"
 building_type_RICE_pirate_den_01_desc: "The line between an armed merchant and a pirate is often blurry. Simple looting is often not a viable long-term goal, so in many maritime regions like the Indian Ocean, elites often work together with pirates for profit and gain, and to weaken mutual foes who are economic competitors."
 building_RICE_pirate_den_01: "Thieves' Hideout"
 building_RICE_pirate_den_01_desc: "Though they are now indirectly subsidized by the state to prey on mutual enemies, the pirates of this region have only begun to establish a foothold in this part of the Indian Ocean."
 building_RICE_pirate_den_02: "Black Market"
 building_RICE_pirate_den_02_desc: "The pirates of this region are working more closely with local lords to steal goods from rival merchants and smuggle them elsewhere. It is a profitable arrangement, and not an uncommon one in the Indian Ocean."
 building_RICE_pirate_den_03: "Corsair Port"
 building_RICE_pirate_den_03_desc: "Pirate bands here have amassed enough wealth and influence, with the help of regional rulers, to maintain their own sanctuaries where they can manage their fleets and engage in trade."
 building_RICE_pirate_den_04: "Sea Fortress"
 building_RICE_pirate_den_04_desc: "Here lies a mighty stronghold to safeguard these shores and intimidate those who dare defy both the pirates who dwell here and the local rulers who support them. Whether it comes to filling their coffers or fighting enemies, their interests of these two groups are one and the same."
 
 building_type_RICE_bawarij_den_01: "Bawarij Den"
 building_type_RICE_bawarij_den_01_desc: "The Bawarij Corsairs are some of the most feared pirates in the Indian Ocean, who have traditionally operated from their base in Socotra. For years, they have had the foresight to work with local Socotran leaders for mutual gain, whether openly or clandestinely."
 building_RICE_bawarij_den_01: "Bawarij Hideout"
 building_RICE_bawarij_den_01_desc: "While the Bawarij Corsairs, who hail from India, have used Socotra as a base of operations for centuries, the island is less an organized headquarters, and more a convenient sanctuary where the Barawij can hide, rest, and prey on merchant vessels."
 building_RICE_bawarij_den_02: "Bawarij Entrepot"
 building_RICE_bawarij_den_02_desc: "The Bawarij have begun to establish themselves more permanently on Socotra, cooperating (and occasionally coming into conflict) with the local leadership as needed, and engaging in trade as well."
 building_RICE_bawarij_den_03: "Bawarij Harbor"
 building_RICE_bawarij_den_03_desc: "Having accumulated increasingly more wealth and power, both the Bawarij and their collaborators on Socotra can now maintain larger war fleets as well as a sizeable trading seaport."
 building_RICE_bawarij_den_04: "Bawarij Stronghold"
 building_RICE_bawarij_den_04_desc: "With help from their business partners and stalwart allies, the rulers of Socotra, the Bawarij Corsairs shall surely live on as one of the most feared and famed pirates of the Indian Ocean, as they send out great armadas of warships and armed merchant vessels from their base."
 
 building_type_RICE_socotra_dragon_blood_forest_01: "Dragon's Blood Forests"
 building_type_RICE_socotra_dragon_blood_forest_01_desc: "Dragon Blood trees are one of Socotra's most distinctive plants. These mushroom shaped trees produce a red sap that has been renowned since ancient times."
 building_RICE_socotra_dragon_blood_forest_01: "Dragon's Blood Forests"
 building_RICE_socotra_dragon_blood_forest_01_desc: "The wilderness of Socotra is dotted with many Dragon's Blood trees. Though scattered haphazardly, men from the local villages have time-honored methods of extracting the precious red sap from these trees."
 building_RICE_socotra_dragon_blood_forest_02: "Dragon's Blood Groves"
 building_RICE_socotra_dragon_blood_forest_02_desc: "As Socotra continues to grow and thrive, more efficient methods of profiting from the Dragon's Blood trees are developing in order to meet the demand for the red sap from these trees."
 building_RICE_socotra_dragon_blood_forest_03: "Dragon's Blood Plantations"
 building_RICE_socotra_dragon_blood_forest_03_desc: "A good number of the Dragon's Blood trees on Socotra are now part of a more systematic industry, and an integral part of Socotra's economy, though there are still wild forests of the plant on the island here and there."

 socotra.0005.desc: "For years, pirates have operated from the coast of [capital_province.GetName] to prey on merchant vessels sailing the Indian Ocean, yet there is more to gain if we work together. After all, it is not uncommon for ordinary merchants - like ones we do business with - to turn to piracy to make extra coin, nor is it unheard of for pirates to offer their services to enterprising lords. But previously, such things were done in an ad hoc, disorganized manner within our realm.\n\nNow, we have struck a deal with the local pirates. In exchange for letting them establish an official base in our territory, they will raid the shores of our foes on our behalf and provide us a share of the loot, as well as support us in our military ventures. There is no shame in associating with pirates; it is merely another tool we have in our arsenal to protect our economic and political interests in the ever dynamic, dangerous world of the Indian Ocean."

But for centuries, the island was also decentralized, ruled by petty chiefs, or haphazardly colonized by foreign powers who wished to profit from the island's abundance of exotic products.\n\nBut a new day is dawning on Socotra. Today, I have proclaimed myself the first [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] of a unified, centralized island.

 socotra.0010.desc.stewardship: "For many years, Socotra has been a haven for runaway slaves, many of whom are African in origin. Some of them are quite skilled. Today, one such ex-slave, a new arrival, offers his services. Due to his ability to read and do arithmetic, as a slave, he previously helped his master manage finances. He is clearly a sharp, organized individual."

Today, one such ex-slave, a new arrival, offers his services. His origins are mysterious, and he was involved in the criminal world. He claims to have many useful connections and abilities in subterfuge."
 socotra.0010.desc.learning: "For many years, Socotra has been a haven for runaway slaves, many of whom are African in origin. Some of them are quite skilled.

He is not only literate, but unusually articulate and well-read - perhaps he was a scholar in his homeland before he was captured and enslaved? He clearly has a knack for intellectual pursuits, and he hopes he can be of use to me at my court."

He was formerly a member of the Bawarij, the notorious Indian corsairs based on Socotra who engage in piracy on the coasts of the western Indian Ocean. If I am willing to overlook his criminal record, I might make use of his vast knowledge of naval warfare, trade, sailing and traveling, and the inner workings of local pirate groups. His connections might also be of great help to me."

 socotra.0020.desc: "Among the peoples who originated in South Arabia and Socotra, like us [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNoun], those who can speak poetry are held in the highest esteem. Our poets are not direct and assertive like the poets of our Arabic-speaking cousins, for we focus more on subtleties and hidden meanings, secret symbols and clever twists of fate. Poetry is embedded deeply into our culture - it is sung by peasants working in the field and butchers as they slaughter sheep, by warriors as they charge into battle and holy men as they give sermons.\n\nNow, I have decided to host a major poetry competition in [ROOT.Char.GetCapitalLocation.GetTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]! Which man or woman will prove themselves the worthiest of poets this year?"
 socotra.0020.a: "Announce this contest to all - anyone willing can participate!"
 socotra.0021.t: "The Prize"
 socotra.0021.desc: "As preparations are underway for the poetry contest, how big will the prize be? Though poetry is a great reward in and of itself, and should not be soiled by material needs, it doesn't hurt as an incentive."
 socotra.0021.a: "No prize is needed, only recognition and fame."
 socotra.0021.b: "A small prize will do."
 socotra.0021.c: "A medium sized prize."

For several days, men and women will compete in several rounds before a panel of judges chosen from the most esteemed and respected poets of [GetPlayer.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier] and many have come to watch this spectacle. Overall, the turnout for this contest seems good.\n\nUnlike our Arabian cousins elsewhere, we freely encourage men and women to mingle and compete against one another in poetry, and our contestants come from all walks of life, from dignified nobles to humble beggars. Some of my courtiers are even contestants as well. It will be interesting to see what poems they come up with this year and who will win!"
 socotra.0022.a: "This is exciting! I wonder who will win?"
 socotra.0022.b: "As a learned [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan], I can also be a judge."

 socotra.0023.desc: "For several days, I and many others witness many compete for victory in the poetry contest. These men and women improvise original poem after poem off the top of their heads on various topics provided by the judges. Some are humble, humorous little anecdotes, others are tales about good versus evil, but most use the veiled language - here, words do not always mean what they mean, for the best poets hide true meaning behind clever symbols or plot twists.\n\nAnyways, many poets have been eliminated after the initial rounds, and now only few remain."
 socotra.0023.a: "The final round is upon us - who will win?"
 socotra.0024.t: "The Winning Poet"

 socotra.0024.desc.winner_2: "She is a simple weaver, who makes clothes and sells them in the local markets. They say she sings lovely poems to advertise her wares, and one can imagine how popular her products are.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_3: "He is a former sailor, an old veteran of the seas who settled nearby. His voice is coarse, sure, but that only gives a time-worn and ancient flair to his poem. No doubt some of his more vivid ideas are informed by the exotic, faraway lands he visited as a strapping young man.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_4: "She is an herbalist and a wisewoman, kind and helpful to all. Though she lives alone, she is never truly lonely, for many visit her to get her cures and hear her poetry.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_5: "He is a servant for a wealthy family, but he has learned well by observing all around him. Clearly he picked up a thing or two about life's drama by listening in on his masters’ conversations!\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_6: "She is a portly mother of many children, who spends most of her time managing her household. Bold and assertive, they say even when she scolds and nags her many children, there is a poetic quality to it.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_7: "He is a merchant, who is prosperous and well off. With a honeyed tongue, a cunning mind, and good grasp of human nature, no wonder he is so successful in business and poetry!\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_8: "She is the daughter of a nobleman. Yet this is no sheltered, spoiled lady. Her voice is lofty and pleasing to the ear, carrying with it whispers of the world - she clearly sees much and thinks about our place in the cosmos.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_9: "He is a former slave, who escaped here years ago, and gets by doing odd jobs. Yet the diversity of his experiences has come in handy, reflecting in his poetry, and he is good at mimicking the styles of many others.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_10: "She is a local prostitute, possessing a sweet dulcet voice, eloquent as she is notorious. They say men flock to her like bees to honey, but even jealous housewives admit they find her poetry seductive.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_11: "He is a scholar, one of the few from a local village who can read and write. Yet he does not let his knowledge of letters affect his recitations of poetry - on the contrary, it enhances his skill in upholding this oral tradition.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_12: "She is an older noble lady, regal of bearing, who dwells in a nearby mansion. Though widowed, it is clear she spends much of her time perfecting her poetry.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_13: "He is a local ne’er-do-well, a rogue of low morals, so some who knew him were surprised he even won. Yet others are not surprised. After all, a successful rogue must know how to convince and persuade others in order to survive, and poetry is simply a higher form of that.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_14: "She is a maid in a prosperous household. Her master and mistress were kind enough to encourage natural poetic talent, and it has definitely paid off.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_15: "He is a middle aged noble. He can be a little arrogant, but at least when it comes to his poetry, his arrogance is well deserved. His voice carries authority, as if he could claim something ludicrous and everyone would believe it.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_16: "She is an elderly lady, one of the oldest in the land, who has many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Such an aged person has much wisdom and experience they can put into words and song.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_17: "He is a holy man, who spends most of his days reading scriptures, reciting prayers, and contemplating the divine in the name of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]. But surely this only gives his poetry a more ethereal quality.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_18: "She is a beggar, the lowest of the low. Though here we know that poetry comes from many sources, we are surprised that such a person is so capable. How did we miss her for so long?\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_19: "He is one of my lesser officials, a humble clerk. But it seems this clerk has dreamed of greater things than merely the paperwork at his desk. His voice is heavenly, surely something more than what one would expect for someone of his station!\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_20: "She is the former concubine of a notorious pirate, cast aside when he lost interest in her. But she has not lost any of her beauty - neither the beauty of her face nor the beauty of her words and voice.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_21: "He is a local town guard. Many thought he was a mere brute, more brawn than brain. Clearly not! Good poetry can come from anyone, one just has to merely wait and find out from who. Despite the simplicity of his poetry, none can deny the eloquence in its brevity!\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_22: "She is a young maiden, old enough to look for a husband, yet undecided on who to choose. Many say she already has many suitors, each wishing that he could hear her poetry forever, but she wants an intelligent, articulate husband who can compete with her when it comes to poetry. Who knows if she shall ever find such a man?\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_23: "He is a fisherman who goes out to sea often to make ends meet. Every time he is out there, he must be singing these beautiful poems, luring the fish into his nets with his soothing voice.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_24: "She is a wife of one of my soldiers, tough and a little rough around the edges, but this only adds a certain blunt charm to her words. Her eyes are like fire, her words fiery.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_25: "He is one of the men who works to collect and sell frankincense. His work is hard and he often toils under the sun, but this seems to inspire him more. He often sings and practices his poetry while he is out in the field.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_26: "She is a wild woman, some say, someone who lost her mind years ago. Others claim she is a wise seer. Whoever she is, none can deny her mastery of poetry. Perhaps it is divinely inspired?\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_27: "He is a local date farmer. They say his father was a foreign sailor or trader who seduced his mother before running away, explaining his odd appearance. He doesn't talk much about his origins, but one can pick up hints of his feelings in his poetry.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_28: "She is the daughter of a pretty slave girl whose master bedded often as his concubine, yet he did not acknowledge the child - this woman - as his. For whatever reason, when he died, he freed mother and daughter in his will and the girl is now a simple maidservant. It is clear her humble origins have influenced her poetry.\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_29: "He is a young commoner who will soon get married. He and his bride-to-be, who have been friends since they were children, are deeply in love. He smiles at her as he recites his poem. Who knows what hidden meanings he has left in the poem, little secrets and jests that only she will understand?\n\n"
 socotra.0024.desc.winner_30: "She is but a mere adolescent, to everyone’s surprise. Yet her voice is firm, and her words wise and moving. There are adults who are twice, nay, three or four times her age, who only possess a fraction of her skill in speech.

 socotra.0024.desc.poem_1: "The poem is an epic of human morality and mortality, and is about a jaded, ruthless pirate woman condemned to live for centuries by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] to guide the souls of the dead into the afterlife. One day, [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] sends a handsome but soft-hearted scholar to be her assistant, and she feels hope in life again. Alas, her sentence is almost finished, so she herself must pass on just as she falls in love. Everyone is in tears when the story is finished - such a bittersweet  yet profound tale!"
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_2: "The poem is a simple but comical love story about an ugly girl who finds magical cosmetics that make her look beautiful. People admire her fake beauty, so she goes through great lengths to hide her true, ugly face without cosmetics. A prince discovers what she really looks like, yet he still falls in love with her because of her kind, pure heart, so he agrees to keep her secret. The two lovers go through many trials as the girl learns to love herself for her inner and outer beauty, before they marry. Everyone laughs at the embarrassing antics the girl and the Prince get into to protect her secret."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_3: "The poem is a simple and sweet fairy tale about a poor girl who, with the help of a magical fish, outwits her evil stepparents and wins the heart of a kind Sultan. Yet despite its simplicity, the poet made many cry and weep at the girl's ordeals."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_4: "The poem concerns a humorous exchange between two thieves who cheat each other without realizing each other's intentions. Once they realize the truth, they don't come to blows, but instead laugh at their folly."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_5: "The poem is a classic love story. A boy and a girl meet and fall in love. Obstacles conspire to separate them, but they overcome these challenges and happily marry."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_6: "The poem is about the poet’s family history, and about one great deed of an ancestor from long ago. Whether true or not, whether this ancestor is even real, the story is entertaining!"
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_7: "The poem is a biting satire that makes fun of everyone and anyone. None can escape the poet’s criticisms, some well-deserved."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_8: "The poem is an ode to the beauty of our land, but also an ode to the good people who dwell there. People are ultimately good and can do good things, the poet argues in the veiled language. An idealistic poem if there was ever one!"
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_9: "The poem is a tragedy about the downfall of a person because of their hubris and their moral failings. Such stories, whether told in poetic form or not, are always a fable that all of us should heed!"
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_10: "The poem is about a merchant or sailor who travels to faraway land so that he may find riches and profit. The poet seems to poke fun at people's greed, too, when they portray this merchant or sailor as insatiably ravenous in his pursuit of wealth and glory."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_11: "The poem is about an adventurer who travels to another land and finds himself trapped with all sorts of dangers but escapes through his wits - no matter if he faces bloodthirsty man-eating monsters, wild tribes of Amazons, cruel and vindictive Sultans, or everyday scoundrels, he always comes out on top. That does not mean that the poem isn’t a nail-biter, though."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_12: "The poem is about a lazy but clever man who outsmarts others to get away with his sloth. Thus, he never has to do hard work. Truly, a funny story!"
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_13: "The poem is about the simple life of herdsmen and fishermen, and the animals they interact with every day. The poet has a way of helping everyone visualize the landscape, the scenery, and the work these people do."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_14: "The poem is a sad story about unrequited love. By a cruel twist of fate, the protagonist dies, crying out their beloved’s name, yet their beloved will never know of their devotion."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_15: "The poem is a historical tale that recalls one of the earlier events of the land's history, and all the politics, intrigue, and warring involved. Some details may have been changed or made up as poetic license."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_16: "The poem is a polite and formal, yet biting and unrestrained critique of another well-known villager in the poet’s hometown. Clearly the two had some disagreements in the past, and the poet shows no qualms about making this rivalry public."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_17: "The poem is advice to a friend who recently got themselves in a quandary. Though the poet slyly used metaphors and symbols to mask the true events and people involved, strangely, everyone feels as if they learned something even if we won't ever know the full details."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_18: "The poem seems irreverent at first, speaking of mundane things, but eventually it becomes clear that it is actually a friendly yet very subtle teasing towards the poet’s friend, who happens to be the poet who got second place. The two of them exchange knowing looks - it is clear that for some of the metaphors, only they will ever understand."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_19: "The poem is simultaneously hilarious yet unsettlingly odd, in a way no one feels they can truly understand. It is about a brother and a sister who challenge each other to a game of cleaning each other's teeth. What is the deeper meaning here?"
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_20: "The poem is about a girl who has no choice but to ask a conman who once deceived her to save her beloved from a wrathful djinn. The conman reluctantly agrees, for despite his profession and his jaded outlook on life, he is a moral man deep down. How ironic that a villain is turned into a hero!"
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_21: "The poem is about a beautiful peasant girl from a local village, who is courted by a wealthy stranger - perhaps a Prince of some foreign land, or a merchant who possesses many riches. He offers her many gifts, each more luxurious than the last, yet she refuses to become his concubine and maintains her honor to her name and her tribe. In the end, she marries a handsome, local boy she had known since they were children."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_22: "The poem is a comical one about an idiot and a misadventure he gets into. Yet, despite his stupidity, his good nature ensures that no misfortune can ever dissuade him from a positive mindset."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_23: "The poem is a reenactment of a legal dispute between two neighbors. The poet skillfully weaves a story where the audience does not know which side to support - both parties have their good points, and reasons why they are in the right. Vivid metaphors are used to symbolize the intensity of their arguments."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_24: "The poem is told from the perspective of a young maiden, who explains what she is looking for in a suitor. She has high expectations, almost comically so. Will she ever find someone she deems worthy of being her husband? The poet intentionally ends the poem on a cliffhanger."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_25: "The poem is a retelling of a poem improvised by a famous but very arrogant poet from centuries ago. In the old poem, which everyone knows, the poet praised the impenetrable defenses of his town's fortifications. The irony comes from the fact that the town was razed to the ground by enemies many years later. The current poet is twisting the original metaphors and symbols which were smug shows of superiority into a warning about the dangers of hubris. Quite clever!"
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_26: "The poem is an apology to someone the poet wronged not too long ago, eloquent in its use of symbols to convey the poet’s deep regret and hope for reconciliation. The person they are apologizing to happens to be in the crowd, and acknowledges the apology with a curt nod."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_27: "The poem praises the beauty of someone, albeit it is hard to tell who exactly given the many layers of veiled language involved. So many metaphors! Perhaps it is just a discussion of beauty in the abstract, or perhaps it is praise to someone the poet admires but is too shy to talk to."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_28: "The poem is a rather intellectual discussion on the society we live in. It explores our customs, ideas, and beliefs, and what might be good and what might be evil. Everyone who hears the poem will surely contemplate these profound matters for days to come."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_29: "The poem is about two people who care about each other very much - perhaps two lovers, or a parent and child, or good friends - who are separated due to circumstance. The poet expresses the feelings of sorrow about the separation these two have, and hope that they will someday be reunited."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_30: "The poem is told from the point of view of a bird that flies from one land to another across the great blue seas. The poet expertly describes what the vast expanse of land and ocean the bird sees from its vantage point, and everyone challenges themselves to understand the deeper meaning of the metaphors the poet uses."
 socotra.0024.desc.poem_31: "xxxxx"
 socotra.0024.a: "An amazing poem indeed! And to think it was improvised on the spot."
 socotra.0025.t: "The Poetry Contest Ends"
 socotra.0025.desc: "The competition is over, and the victor can now return home. No doubt a great celebration will be held in their honor in their hometown, and whatever their origins, today has surely been a turning point in their life. Already, people are lining the streets and hills, exchanging songs of poetry in an atmosphere of joy and creativity."

 socotra.0030.t: "Tensions Rising"
 socotra.0030.desc: "The Muslims on Socotra claim that some of Socotra’s laws unfairly target their community, and that some of my officials have taken advantage of them to further oppress them. There are rumors that an eloquent and charismatic woman among them is emerging as a leader of this movement against my corrupt officials and what they see as unjust laws. While there has not been any indication that an open revolt will happen, these developments are worrying."
 socotra.0030.a: "Surely, nothing serious will come out of this."
 socotra.0031.t: "Zahra the Poet"
 socotra.0031.desc.muslim: "Years of abuse at the hands of corrupt officials and unjust laws have caused much unrest among the Muslims of Socotra. Thankfully, whether due to conquest or conversion, they are now under proper Muslim rulers (at least in name), and no longer have to worry about being oppressed by infidels.\n\nTheir chief representative is a woman named Zahra, a poet of some renown. She has been critical in helping with the transition of power, and today has come to my court. “Praise [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] that you now rule us,” she says. “We hope you will be a just and honorable ruler, one who is untainted by corruption and malice.”"
 socotra.0031.desc: "Years of abuse at the hands of corrupt officials and unjust laws have caused much unrest among the Muslims of Socotra. Their chief representative is [RICE_socotra_zahra_character.Custom('TitledFirstName')], a poet of some renown. Today, she is airing their grievances with me.\n\n“All we ask for is fair and just treatment, [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] [ROOT.Char.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')],” she says. “Please consider relaxing the restrictions and unjust laws placed on us, and look into the unrighteous actions some officials have done to besmirch your good name.”\n\nHer eloquent demands come off more as a friendly request, even if there is the implicit threat of further unrest. I have heard she plans to send word to other Muslim rulers to ask for their aid if I refuse her demands, so I must tread carefully."
 socotra.0031.a: "Praise be to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]!"
 socotra.0031.b: "Very well! Perhaps we can negotiate an agreement."
 socotra.0031.c: "You dare imply I am a tyrant? Be careful what you say, poet."
 socotra.0032.t: "Peace on Socotra"
 socotra.0032.desc: "Zahra looks surprised, but pleased nonetheless. “I am touched by your magnanimity, noble one,” she says, bowing. “If this is truly your wish, then let us work together to heal the wounds caused by the unfortunate decisions of a malevolent few.”\n\n“You speak eloquently, oh poet,” you tell her. “Indeed, let us work together!”"
 socotra.0032.a: "A new beginning for Socotra?"
 socotra.0033.t: "Tensions on Socotra"
 socotra.0033.desc: "Zahra doesn’t look surprised at your reaction, and merely nods in defeat. “Very well. Perhaps I was misguided, then, and I thank you for your mercy and generosity in listening to me present my case.”\n\nShe bows, and takes her leave. I only hope that she will use her influence to help ease the tensions in Socotra, but perhaps that is a foolish assumption on my part."
 socotra.0033.a: "Who knows what she will be up to?"
 socotra.0034.opening: "To the noble [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] [ROOT.Char.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')], a cry for help:"
 socotra.0034.desc: "Tell the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] whose virtues are to be hoped for, the son of the noble and distinguished men:\nSocotra has become empty of Islam after Islamic law and the Qur'an.\nThe infidels have committed an outrage against us, have taken women captive, and have continued to plunder.\nOh men! Help every Muslim woman, even if you creep along on your chins and knees."

 socotra.0041.desc: "The Moon is a powerful entity, capable of great blessings and great curses. Since time immemorial, Socotrans have conducted sacrifices in its honor. We see no conflict between these practices - considered sorcerous at best and demonic at worst by foreigners - and worship of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName].\n\nI have arranged for a great sacrifice to be held to the moon tonight, and many will participate in it. A local elder will be there to interpret the results of my sacrifice. Now, what kind of sacrifice did I arrange for the moon?"
 socotra.0041.a: "A standard sacrifice of fruits and meat"

 socotra.0050.t: "Overgrazing Goats"
 socotra.0050.desc: "Goats have been a ubiquitous presence on the island of Socotra for centuries. Traditionally, Socotran herders have developed a number of methods to reduce overgrazing. However, recently these herders have made some errors in judgment. In a number of places on the island, the soil is no longer good for its native fauna such as the famed Dragon's Blood, resulting in loss of profit for merchants dealing in these rare, exotic commodities. The market for these products will surely suffer for a number of years until the soil can recover."
 socotra.0050.a: "That doesn’t sound good at all."
 socotra.0051.t: "Paradise?"
 socotra.0051.desc: "On the island of Socotra, there are many small valleys and canyons filled with beautiful flowers and trees that are seen nowhere else on earth, as well as doves, pigeons, and other birds that sing songs of paradise. Some of these canyons even have freshwater pools with the bluest of waters. Today I've decided to take some time off to visit one of those pools to escape the heat and relax. I can admire the scenery around me without nary a worry!"
 socotra.0051.a: "The trip was worth it!"
 socotra.0052.t: "Diksam Plateau"
 socotra.0052.desc: "Socotra is home to many exotic plants which produce a number of rare products that are in high demand throughout the world. Today I am visiting Diksam plateau on the island, where one of these plants, the famed Dragon's Blood tree, grows in large amounts. I am inspecting the Grove of Dragon's Blood trees while a peasant explains the techniques used to extract the precious Dragon's Blood resin. In the distance, laborers sing poems to one another as they work."
 socotra.0052.a: "Fascinating!"
 socotra.0053.t: "Dragons"
 socotra.0053.desc: "One of the exotic plants found only on Socotra is the Dragon's Blood tree, which can be distinguished by its unusual mushroom shape, and which dot the island’s landscape. They have been prized since ancient times due to the unusually bright red resin they produce.\n\nThere are those who say the tree produces this red resin because the plant originated from the blood of dragons, hence its name. Others say this is a fanciful tale that those in foreign lands came up with when they first saw the resin."
 socotra.0053.a: "Socotra has many strange plants and animals. Dragons are plausible!"
 socotra.0053.b: "I doubt dragons were involved. We’re just blessed the trees are here."
 socotra.0054.t: "Marvels of Socotra"
 socotra.0054.desc: "A traveler of some renown is staying at my residence in Socotra and we are discussing the unique aspects of the island. He is a foreigner who has not been to these parts before, and he says he is amazed at how there are many different unique plants and animals that are found here and nowhere else - not to mention the land’s picturesque beauty!"
 socotra.0054.a: "The island is very blessed."
 socotra.0054.b: "We are no more special than any other place."
 socotra.0054.c: "It is the people who make this land special."
 socotra.0055.t: "Bawarij Problem"
 socotra.0055.desc: "Socotra may seem like a paradise, but it is no stranger to strife and danger either, as it is located in the middle of many important trade routes. Though we rulers of Socotra often have deals and arrangements with the Bawarij Corsairs from India who make the island their base, these pirates have been particularly rowdy this year and the Bawarij leaders are unable to control their men from attacking neutral or friendly ships…. or perhaps the leaders are looking the other way to indirectly challenge my authority!"
 socotra.0055.a: "Send in soldiers to intimidate them."
 socotra.0055.a.success: "You successfully convince the pirates to listen to you... or else"
 socotra.0055.a.failure: "You fail to convince them with your pathetic attempts at intimidation"
 socotra.0055.b: "Negotiate with their leaders."
 socotra.0055.b.success: "You successfully help the Bawarij leaders discipline their ranks"
 socotra.0055.b.failure: "You and the Bawarij leaders fail to discipline their men"
 socotra.0055.c: "This isn't my concern whatsoever."
 socotra.0055.success: "The Bawarij leaders are able to control their men"
 socotra.0055.failure: "The Bawarij leaders are unable to control their men"
 socotra.0056.t: "Old Socotra"
 socotra.0056.desc: "In olden times, Socotra was a major production center of frankincense. These days it is not as in high demand, but it is still considered a valuable commodity. One can only imagine how wealthy your predecessors as ruler of Socotra must have been in the days of the ancient civilizations such as the Romans and the Egyptians!"
 socotra.0056.a: "One can only imagine."
 socotra.0057.t: "What are Socotra's qualities?"
 socotra.0057.desc: "Socotra’s legends and lore have always attracted much attention since ancient times. A traveling scholar has visited my court, and wishes to investigate the history, lore, and environment of the island, and hopes to do that by first talking with me, Socotra’s ruler, before discussing matters with the island's inhabitants, as well as the merchants and Bawarij Corsairs who frequent it. There is so much to talk about, given the island's uniqueness, but I begin with Socotra's…"
 socotra.0057.a: "Exotic plants like Dragon's Blood or Cucumber Tree"
 socotra.0057.b: "Ruling family - my own - and how we rose to power"
 socotra.0057.c: "Position as an important center of maritime trade"
 socotra.0057.d: "People, and their vital role as the island’s inhabitants"
 socotra.0058.t: "Dolphins"
 socotra.0058.desc: "Today I spotted a number of dolphins in the ocean by a beach not too far from my home in Socotra. Locals say such sightings are a sign of good luck!"
 socotra.0058.a: "Wonderful!"
 socotra.0059.t: "Shipwreck"
 socotra.0059.desc: "Oftentimes, merchant ships traveling between East Africa, the Middle East, and India will have to pass through the Gulf of Aden. As such, if these ships get caught up in a storm in this region, they’ll often wash up on the shores of Socotra.\n\nThe wreck of several large ships that probably belonged to a major trade fleet recently washed up on a secluded beach on the island, and locals have wisely brought the matter up to my officials. It seems that the wreck of these ships haven't been looted yet, so I can decide what can be done with the salvageable merchandise on board. I’ll need to make a decision quickly, before someone tries to take it all for themselves."
 socotra.0059.a: "Give all of it to me, of course!"
 socotra.0059.b: "Give most of it to the local leaders."
 socotra.0059.c: "Give most of it to the locals."
 socotra.0060.t: "Foul Play in the Coral Reefs"
 socotra.0060.desc: "A well-to-do fisherman in Socotra who was considered something of a community leader among the commoners recently died in a tragic accident. While out fishing, his boat got stuck in a coral reef and as he tried to swim back he was attacked by reef sharks. Investigation reveals foul play was involved, as his boat was sabotaged, and a man who was his rival has been implicated. The evidence is ultimately too strong and damning, and the man admits to his wrongdoing. As the ruler of Socotra, it is I who must sentence the man for this crime."
 socotra.0060.a: "Why don't we let the locals deal with him?"
 socotra.0060.b: "This criminal will be rightfully executed!"
 socotra.0061.t: "Chameleon"
 socotra.0061.desc: "I was walking one day somewhere in Socotra when I came across a chameleon. It was frightened, and hissed at me before changing into various colors and scurrying off. When I returned home and discussed this with my [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('lowly_servant_type')] later that evening, I was warned me that according to Socotran folklore, a person who hears a chameleon hiss will lose the ability to speak."
 socotra.0061.a: "That’s just a superstition."
 socotra.0061.b: "Oh no! What should I do now?"
 socotra.0061.tooltip: "You receive the chameleon's curse!"
 socotra.0062.t: "Simply Poetry"
 socotra.0062.desc: "I pass by a village in Socotra and see some men lounging about, probably laborers taking a break from work. They are drumming and clapping, and singing some improvised poetry. Poetry is a way of life on this island, and pervades its culture like none other. It is not uncommon to hear locals from all walks of life spontaneously improvise poetry as they go about their daily business."
 socotra.0062.a: "I listen to the stories for a while, before continuing on my way."
 socotra.0063.t: "Cave Picnic"
 socotra.0063.desc: "Every now and then I and some of my courtiers decide to have lunch in one of the many caves overlooking the rest of Socotra island. Though the trek there can be arduous, it is worth the effort, given the beauty such locations have to offer. For today's lunch, how shall we enjoy ourselves in the cave we’ve decided to do our picnic in?"
 socotra.0063.a: "Peacefully observe the villages and landscape below."
 socotra.0063.b: "Admire the desert rose flowers growing along the canyon walls."
 socotra.0063.c: "Explore the pools of water and ancient inscriptions in the cave."
 socotra.0064.t: "Socotran Fishermen"
 socotra.0064.desc: "While traveling through one of the fishing villages in Socotra, the fishermen offer me some of their recent catch. The island has always teemed with many kinds of seafood! What do I wish to take home with me?"
 socotra.0064.a: "Sea Urchins would be great."
 socotra.0064.b: "Those crabs there look good."
 socotra.0064.c: "Any fish you have will do."
 socotra.0064.d: "I am not interested."
 socotra.0065.t: "Ayaft Canyon"
 socotra.0065.desc: "Today I'm paying a visit to Ayaft Canyon. As a natural valley that collects much moisture it is the greenest place on Socotra island, and thus it is where much of the island's frankincense is grown, as it has been for generations. Even though the frankincense trade isn’t as profitable as it used to be many centuries ago, a large portion of the island’s wealth still derives from it. Under the shade of the conical shaped Dragon's Blood trees, I discuss with the locals about how the production of frankincense is coming along for this year."
 socotra.0065.a: "Seems like it will be another good year."
 socotra.0066.t: "Lost!"
 socotra.0066.desc: "There are many caves on the island of Socotra and locals enjoy visiting them every now and then for leisure. I was exploring one of the caves in Socotra with a few guards when I got lost, and separated from my companions! Cautiously, I wander around, careful not to stumble or fall into the freshwater pools.\n\n“Hello! Is anyone there? Hello?” I cry out."
 socotra.0066.a: "I see the shape of something dark up ahead."
 socotra.0067.t: "Cave Paintings"
 socotra.0067.desc: "It is hard to see in the darkness, but as my eyes adjust, I am greeted with a most spectacular sight. There are primitive, ancient paintings on the wall, perhaps drawn centuries ago, that depict people, trees, and some random shapes. A few of the people appear to be wearing some sort of antlers on their head. Meanwhile, there are some scrawled lines, perhaps writing in some ancient language.\n\nAfter admiring this strange art for some time, eventually I find my way back outside, to the relief of everyone who was looking for me. But even as I go home, I am fascinated by those wall paintings. I remember even as a child, the elders would talk of how Socotra has been inhabited by people for many centuries. Even now, I can almost hear the whispers and footsteps of the men and women who made those paintings eons ago."
 socotra.0067.a: "Who were they? "
 socotra.0068.t: "Date Pastries"
 socotra.0068.desc: "Socotra is not a particularly large island, so the local cuisine can be limited at times if one doesn’t hail from one of the big towns. Still, that doesn't mean it's bad at all. Today, some villagers wish to pay their respects to me - as they spontaneously recite poems praising me, their ruler, they give me a gift of local pastries made using dates. These are a simple yet delicious delicacy!"
 socotra.0068.a: "A welcome gift. Thank you."
 socotra.0069.t: "Alexander's Heirs"
 socotra.0069.desc: "I am visiting one of the villages on Socotra and discussing business with the local leadership. Several clans in this village claim descent from Greek soldiers of Alexander the Great, and indeed a few of them have physical features considered rare in this region such as lighter eyes. Some of their elders even say they know a few Greek words.\n\nAccording to legend, the ambitious conqueror sent a small force to explore and map out the Arabian coast in preparation for his conquest of the region, but as he died young these intrepid explorers were left stranded and settled on Socotra. However, is this really the case? It's been many centuries after all. Some say this is just something they use to feel superior to the clans of other villages."
 socotra.0069.a: "Perhaps they're truly descended from Alexander the Great's soldiers!"
 socotra.0069.b: "It's a fanciful tale but an interesting one nonetheless, I'll admit."
 socotra.0069.c: "It’s likelier they descend from more recent Greek merchants who passed by."
 socotra.0070.t: "Where are the phoenixes?"
 socotra.0070.desc: "A noted traveler has come to Socotra and is visiting my court. He expressed his disappointment that contrary to what he had heard from legends, rumors, and ancient writings, there are no phoenixes to be found on Socotra, other than a few unsubstantiated and unreliable claims made by some commoners."
 socotra.0070.a: "What did you expect? Phoenixes live elsewhere, not here."
 socotra.0070.b: "I'm sure there are phoenixes out there but are hiding themselves."
 socotra.0071.t: "Socotran Crocodiles"
 socotra.0071.desc: "Some elders claim that crocodiles used to roam many parts of Socotra, but they are an increasingly rare sight. Today, I stumbled across one with my guards."
 socotra.0071.a: "Let’s hurry along and avoid it."
 socotra.0071.b: "I want to stay back and observe it."
 socotra.0071.toast: "The crocodile injures you"
 socotra.0072.t: "Your Sorcerous Ways"
 socotra.0072.desc: "“I have heard that there are those on Socotra who are skilled in sorcery, and can bend the weather to change at will!” the adventurer tells me.\n\nI am hosting this man today, as he is stopping by Socotra on his great trek from and to faraway lands. He is recounting a common rumor among foreign peoples that the native inhabitants of Socotra are dangerous, even malevolent, evil magicians. I try to hold back my laughter, knowing better."
 socotra.0072.a: "Those tales are preposterous - such feats are impossible."
 socotra.0072.b: "Be careful… if you displease me, I might conjure a storm!"
 socotra.0073.t: "Turtle Hunters"
 socotra.0073.desc: "Turtle hunting is an old tradition on the island of Socotra. Turtle meat is used in the local cuisine, and turtle shells are one of the island’s many exports. Recently, local Socotran turtle hunters have reported finding more turtles than usual."
 socotra.0073.a: "Good to hear!"
 socotra.0074.t: "Socotra at Night"
 socotra.0074.desc: "Every now and then, when I am resting in my residence at Socotra at night, and I feel a sense of restlessness, I'll leave my residence along with a few trusted guards. We carefully walk into the island’s wilderness, to the top of the mountains. There, under the starry night sky, I can see much of the coastline of the island, and the somber waves of the ocean that seem to beckon me to faraway adventures. I and my guards sit around and relax for perhaps an hour or two, taking in the beauty of this island, before we return home."
 socotra.0074.a: "Socotra is a wonderful place, isn’t it?"
