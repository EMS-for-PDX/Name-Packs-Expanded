 chios.0101.desc: "News is spreading of how [patmos_repopulator.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has sponsored the construction of a small monastery complex called the monastery of Saint John, on the island of Patmos.\n\nPatmos, which lies south of [chios_county.GetNameNoTier] and Samos, was reputedly where John of Patmos - often associated with John the Apostle and John the Evangelist - is said to have written the Book of Revelation. Now that the holy site has a bit of developed infrastructure, it may only be a matter of time until hardy, brave pilgrims start flocking there."
