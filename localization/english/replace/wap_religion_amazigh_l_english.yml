 #Guanche paganism
 guanche_pagan_desc: "Achamán, the eternal sky god created the land and the water, the fire and the air, all creatures derived their existence from him. Achamán lives in the heights and sometimes descends upon the summits of the mountains, contemplating his creations. According to legend, Guayota kidnapped the sun Magec and trapped it in the volcano Teide, plunging the world into darkness. Humans prayed to Achamán who saved Magec, and instead locked the evil Guayota up in the Teide, where Guayota will reside forever. Guayota continues to torment humans via his offspring, the Tibicenas, demons with the bodies of great wild dogs with red eyes and covered by long black fur. Tibicenas live in deep caves and like their father Guayota, inside mountains; they are also known come out at night to attack humans or livestock."
