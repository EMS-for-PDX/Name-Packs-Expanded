 aachen.0002.desc: "We’ve received word that [aachen_charlemagne_buster.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has just commissioned a most beautiful golden bust of the great and mighty Charlemagne. Those who have seen it say is a striking work of art, and one which is perfect for such a peerless, influential ruler. Certainly, many within Christendom believe he deserves such an honor.\n\nWord has spread far and wide of the bust, which is now housed in the treasury of Aachen Cathedral. It will surely attract even more pilgrims to Aachen, who wish to see all of the holy and secular treasures kept at the city’s Cathedral."
 aachen.0004.desc: "Since his passing, Charlemagne had been entombed in the Palatine Chapel in Aachen Cathedral. Some felt this was too humble an arrangement for such a famous and accomplished figure. [aachen_charlemagne_mover.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has thus just ordered for Charlemagne to be reburied in the main part of Aachen Cathedral. In a lavish ceremony, he was reburied there in a majestic sarcophagus.\n\nFor many years, locals had regarded Charlemagne as a saint, though the Church has not officially canonized him, and has indicated it has no intention to. Still, because he now has a truly splendid resting place, it will surely attract more pilgrims to Aachen to pay their respects to him, whether they believe he is truly a saint or not."
 aachen.0006.desc: "I’ve received news that the old Roman bridge in Maastricht recently collapsed when a large procession of people attempted to cross it. As this bridge had been a critical crossing point over the Meuse, a major river in the area, its sudden loss will likely have negative effects on the region for quite some time. Talk is already under way by various notables in Maastricht, including its ruler, [meuse_bridge_collapser.Custom('TitledFirstName')], on if a replacement bridge is possible, and where it could be built."
 aachen.0008.desc: "Not too long ago, the old Roman bridge in Maastricht collapsed, with considerable loss of life. It also affected the region’s economy negatively. However, thanks to the efforts of Maastricht’s ruler, [meuse_bridge_builder.Custom('TitledFirstName')], and several other important figures in the region, a new bridge has been constructed some distance downstream. It is one of the few stone bridges in the region, and it will surely help facilitate the growth of commerce there."
 aachen.0032.t: "[RICE_aachen_spa_goer.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] Goes Relaxing"
 aachen.0032.desc: "Yesterday, [RICE_aachen_spa_goer.Custom('TitledFirstName')] went to one of the thermal spas in Aachen to rest. These hot springs have been famous since ancient times, and [RICE_aachen_spa_goer.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] seems to have enjoyed [RICE_aachen_spa_goer.GetHerHis] time off."
 aachen.0036.desc: "Yesterday, [RICE_aachen_spa_goer_bad.Custom('TitledFirstName')] went to one of the thermal spas by Aachen to relax. However, instead of actually relaxing like [RICE_aachen_spa_goer_bad.GetSheHe] wanted to, [RICE_aachen_spa_goer_bad.GetSheHe] somehow got into an argument with one of the other spa-goers there! It was about something trivial, as far as I can see, but the incident has put [RICE_aachen_spa_goer_bad.GetHerHim] in a bad mood and [RICE_aachen_spa_goer_bad.GetSheHe] has been complaining about it all day."
