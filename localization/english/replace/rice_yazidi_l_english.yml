It has been theorized that ancient Western Iranian speakers in Northwest Iran, including the Kurds' ancestors, followed a religion related to but distinct from Zoroastrianism, which formed a religious substrate for Yazidism, Yarsanism, and other sects in this region. To further complicate the matter, it is possible orthodox Zoroastrianism and older Northwest Iranian beliefs coexisted. Anyways, a key difference this religion had with orthodox Zoroastrianism was that the primordial sacrifice of a bull was not an evil deed by the evil being Ahriman, but a positive act of creation by the god Mithra. These ideas may have influenced the Roman Cult of Mithras, and been a precursor to the bull sacrifice central to the Feast of the Assembly, an important Yazidi celebration. As such, this activity, while somewhat fictitious, is based on possible trends and beliefs among the Northwest Iranians like the Kurds in antiquity and the early medieval period."

 yazidi.0001.desc: "Stories have spread across the region about a great holy man living in [lalish.GetNameNoTier] who is called Sheikh Adi. Though he was a devout, Sufi mystic who preferred to keep to himself, his steadfast asceticism, endless wisdom, and purported miracles earned him a large following.\n\nSheikh Adi recently passed away, but even this is not enough to deter his followers, who include not only pious [islam.GetAdjective] locals, but also those who practice the ancient beliefs long-held by the peoples of Northwest Iran. To detractors, his followers worship him excessively, but locals claim he does deserve veneration as a truly great man – and perhaps one who is more than meets the eye.\n\nEither way, it appears Sheikh Adi’s teachings are blending together with the local spiritual practices and ideas in this region. It remains to be seen how influential his memory will remain in the long run."
 yazidi.0001.a: "Interesting…."

He was respected by the locals, both those who practiced orthodox [islam.GetNameNoTooltip], and those who adhered to the old beliefs long-held by the peoples of Northwest Iran.\n\nThe beliefs of these two groups, and their deep veneration for Sheikh Adi, blended together over the years to give rise to new religious ideas and practices in the isolated, rugged mountains and valleys of the region. Central to their beliefs are the #italic Seven Angels#!, manifestations of God which include not only Sheikh Adi but Melek Taus, the Peacock Angel\n\nThis new spiritual tradition, called [yazidi.GetName], is gaining ground among some of the tribes here, though followers of established religions view them with suspicion at best, and treat them as degenerate infidels at worst."

 yazidi.0003.info: "\n#emphasis Historical Context:#! The Kurds, and the Northwest Iranian peoples more broadly, are theorized to have had ancient religious beliefs that were distinct from but connected to Zoroastrianism; this syncretized with Sufi Islam, such as that which Sheikh Adi preached, to give rise to Yazidism. Thus, Yazidism in its present form emerged sometime after Sheikh Adi’s death in the 1100s.\n\nIn the medieval period and into the early modern period, Yazidis were probably more widespread among the Kurds. For instance, the Ottomans appointed Yazidi emirs to rule some of their territories in Kurdistan, indicating the Yazidis held great political influence back then.\n\nInterestingly, the infamous misconception of the Yazidis being devil worshippers, which is often used to persecute them, is not well attested until the 1500s and 1600s. This raises the possibility that they were considered heterodox Muslims and were only seen as a separate group later on, or that they were at the least not viewed as hostilely by Muslims and Christians until much later."

Despite this, many in that region, including those who follow him, adhere to some older religious practices, as the isolated mountains and valleys have always been home to heterodox sects and beliefs.\n\nAll in all, it seems Sultan Sahak is making efforts to reform their beliefs into something more coherent, and fitting with the Abrahamic creed. There are even those who say that his miracles prove that he is no ordinary holy man, and that he has the divine essence."

Though most Yarsanis speak Kurdish languages, a number speak Turkic.\n\nThe Yarsanis are also known as Ahl-e Haqq or Kaka'i.

By bringing the #italic sanjak#! to various villages, the #italic Qewals#! Give us the opportunity to renew our faith and better understand our religion.\n\nAnyways, I have arrived at the village in question, shortly before the #italic sanjak#! is supposed to arrive.

Everyone knows they are here thanks to the loud, even deafening sound of music filling the village: the tooting of pipes, the banging of tambourines, the thundering of drums.\n\nWe rush to the main road in the village, as the #italic Qewals#! and other spiritual figures enter in procession with the #italic sanjak#! in tow. Some of the onlookers are overcome with emotion, and mutter prayers or bow with great adoration to the bronze effigy. Others try to breathe in and immerse their arms and faces in the smoke emanating from the incense burners held by some of the people in the procession.\n\nThe #italic sanjak#! is marched around the village for some time, before it heads to the house of one of the village notables, where it will remain for the rest of the #italic Tawûs Gêran#!."

Of course, I have already finished my journey there, since I am now partaking in the #italic tiwaf#! festival, but I’m starting to feel rather sore in my muscles.\n\nStill, being out here in nature is inspiring, and seeing the vast expanse of natural scenery and the open skies makes me appreciate [faith.HighGodName] and [faith.HighGodHerHis] creations even more."

It is fortunate we can do both; it is possible to do a #italic Jam#! without them, if no one present has the ability to sing or play the #italic tanbur#!, but we do not have to worry about that today."

The [faith.BishopNeuter] separates the meat from the bones, and places each share, which is called the #italic bash#!, on #italic tiri#! bread.\n\nEach person who is present is given a share of the meat, even the children of the participants who are allowed to observe standing at the edge of the room away from everyone. The #italic kadem#! then brings in a bowl of drinking water for the next part of the ceremony, and each participant, myself included, takes a small sip from this bowl in turn.\n\nAll the while, the singing and music continues, as we all feel the presence of God in this room. Some of us even begin to experience a deep state of ecstasy!"
 yazidi.0043.a: "The atmosphere is one of utmost pure sacredness."
 yazidi.0044.t: "Conclusion"
 yazidi.0044.desc: "At last, the #italic Jam#! ceremony has come to an end. The #italic kadem#! and their helper recite the special Permission Prayer, and kiss the hands of everyone present, starting with the [faith.BishopNeuter]. Once that is done, the [faith.BishopNeuter] declares the ceremony concluded.\n\nAs we all emerge from the #italic $yarsani_house_of_worship$#!, there is no doubt that [faith.HighGodNameAlternate] was present with us in the room just now. Through this, we are brought together as one, and we can find the solutions to the problems which ail us."
 yazidi.0044.a: "I’m glad I could partake in this!"

 yazidi.0060.t: "Preparations"
 yazidi.0060.desc: "Lately, I’ve been gathering the resources needed to make a great sacrifice of a bull.\n\nIn our traditional [faith.GetAdjective] cosmology, at the dawn of time, the great god Mithra sacrificed the primordial bull. Before that, the cosmos initially created by [faith.CreatorGodName] was lacking in life and everything was still; it was thus Mithra’s sacrifice of the bull that allowed the second stage of creation to initiate.\n\nThere are some in other regions who believe this first sacrifice was an evil act, performed by evil beings, including those who we share a great number of religious beliefs and customs with. However, we disagree: the sacrifice was necessary and a good act. Thus, we seek to re-enact the original bull sacrifice ourselves through this religious ritual."
 yazidi.0060.a: "A bull will soon be picked for the occasion."
 yazidi.0061.t: "Re-enacting Creation"
 yazidi.0061.desc: "A bull has been chosen by the [faith.PriestNeuterPlural] for the bull sacrifice, and the day of the sacrifice has come. After the [faith.PriestNeuterPlural] chant various prayers and perform various ceremonies to bring purity and holiness to the occasion, the bull is duly killed.\n\nOnce the whole ceremony is completed, I of course formally thank the [faith.PriestNeuterPlural] for assisting us with this important religious occasion."
 yazidi.0061.a: "I am sure we will do more in the future!"

 yazidi.0080.desc: "A merchant dealing in foodstuffs recently caused a commotion in a nearby [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] town when he attempted to sell some cabbage. Because he was not [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentNameNoTooltip], he either was unaware of, forgot, or didn’t care that in traditional [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjectiveNoTooltip] beliefs, cabbage is considered a forbidden food.\n\nAnyways, while things didn’t get too violent, a lot of locals are angry and demanding I do something about it."
 yazidi.0080.a: "Though he was ignorant, no harm was done."
 yazidi.0080.b: "He needs to publicly apologize for his error."
 yazidi.0080.c: "He should pay a fine for his transgression."
 yazidi.0080.info: "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Traditionally, there are a number of foods that Yazidis are forbidden to eat, of which the most famous is cabbage. A number of reasons have been suggested for this taboo, but one of the more plausible explanations is that the word for cabbage, #italic khas#!, is a homonym of the Yazidi term for a holy being or person."
 yazidi.0081.t: "Blue Clothes"
 yazidi.0081.desc: "A foreign dignitary offered me a number of presents, including blue clothes. However, traditionally in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetName], blue clothes are banned or are at least considered highly undesirable.\n\nOn the other hand, it would be rude to refuse this gift…."
 yazidi.0081.a: "Unacceptable! They should’ve known blue is taboo to us."
 yazidi.0081.b: "For diplomacy’s sake, I have to accept this gift."
 yazidi.0081.c: "I can pretend to accept it, but dispose of it after."
 yazidi.0081.info: "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Blue clothes are generally prohibited among the Yazidis. However, because the definition of blue often varies greatly across cultures, there are times when Yazidis wear clothes that outsiders might consider blue, or, conversely, refuse clothes that don’t look blue to outsiders."
 yazidi.0082.t: "Morning Prayers by Sunlight"
 yazidi.0082.desc: "I wake up early today, and so I take time to say the morning prayers in the direction of the sun, as is [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] custom. I make sure to wash my hands and face before praying, and also make sure to kiss the place where the rays of the sun first entered the room that morning."
 yazidi.0082.a: "Praise to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]! "
 yazidi.0083.t: "The Mešur"
 yazidi.0083.desc: "Today, a #italic Pir#!, one of the hereditary classes of religious masters in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetName], is visiting my court. This #italic Pir#! in particular is known for his knowledge of the #italic mešur#!, which are written accounts of various lineages of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjectiveNoTooltip] families.\n\nAfter welcoming him, he recites for us the contents of the #italic mešur#!, highlighting several prominent families at my court, particularly my own of course. As it is considered taboo to read or write in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetNameNoTooltip] unless you belong to certain special families, these texts are especially useful in helping us remember our ancestry."
