 bookmark_hastings_england_desc: "Harold Godwines sunu was the leader of a powerful noble house, and the brother-in-law of the King, when the childless Eadweard cyning died. Now, elected the new King of England by his peers, he is faced with the challenge of holding onto the throne, as the covetous Duke of Normandy, as well as Haraldr Konungr of Norway, spurred on and aided by Harold's exiled brother, seek to replace him!\n\n#bold With a large army at your back and the support of the Angelcynn lords — will the wolves find that they have bitten off more than they can chew?#!"

 bookmark_hastings_normandy_desc: "The House of Normandy trace their lineage back to Norse vikings, and established themselves on the mainland of Europe over 200 years ago. Now, Williaume II dreams of leading his family to rule the Kingdom of England, and he believes his status as successor to the throne was promised by the late Eadweard cyning, and even recognized by Harold Godwinessunu himself. However, now that Eadweard is gone, Harold has broken his oath and taken the crown for himself!\n\n#bold Williaume is at war with England. Can you muster your forces and claim what is rightfully yours?#!"

 bookmark_hastings_norway_desc: "Having displayed formidable military talent since youth, Haraldr has recently tried, and failed, to conquer Denmark. Now, he looks beyond the sea — by ancient contract, the crown of England should have passed to Haraldr, when the last King died without an heir. But, instead, the Anglo-Saxons have put Harold Godwines sunu on the throne! Luckily, the false King has made enemies, and Tostig Godwinessunu, Harold's own brother, lives in exile in Norway...\n\n#bold By using his own enemies against him, can you give this Varangian viking control over the North Sea?#!"

Unfortunately, his armies are small and undisciplined, making a war of conquest unfeasible. However, there are other ways to pursue one's dreams...\n\n#bold If your children were to be married into powerful families, it could grant many useful alliances — alliances you could leverage to found an empire that would rival Rome itself!#!"

To the south, the rich lands of Northumbria lie vulnerable as England is torn apart by war, but Norse warlords and Gaelic highlanders yet contest the king's rule at home.\n\n#bold The British Isles teem with dangers and opportunities: can you pluck a rose from this garden of thorns?#!"
