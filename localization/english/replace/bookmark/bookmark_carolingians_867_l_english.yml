 bookmark_carolingians_charles_the_bald_desc: "At the time of Charles' birth, his fully grown half-brothers already ruled their own kingdoms within the Carolingian empire. Without a crown of his own, he became known as 'le Chauve,' though he eventually did inherit Aquitaine and West Francia. In the future he will even inherit Italy and the Holy Roman Empire itself, but his line will not persevere — his last grandson will die childless just seven years after his own death.\n\n#bold Can you change the course of history and ensure a long and prosperous line of Charles' decedents?#!"

Their union produced no children, and Lothair's life has been a continuous struggle to divorce his wife and get his bastard children legitimized. Though he never stops trying, Lothair will go on to die without a legal heir.\n\n#bold Can you overcome the machinations of those who plot against you and ensure the continuation of your house?#!"

 bookmark_carolingians_ludwig_the_german_desc: "An ambitious man, Ludwig has long sought to reconquer the pieces of the Empire he considers his birthright. These ambitions have suffered from setback after setback however, as his various military campaigns all ended in failure and his rebellious sons have pried away most of his own lands from his control.\n\n#bold Can you reverse Ludwig's misfortunes and regain the Empire for his descendants, or are his sons destined to be relegated to a mere footnote in history?#!"
