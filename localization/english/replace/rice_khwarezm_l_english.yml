 RICE_khwarezm_the_mad_river_desc: "The Amu Darya or Oxus is one of the great rivers of the world. Though its fertile banks contribute to the prosperity of the surrounding regions, it is also called the "Mad River," for it often shifts its course and overfloods – sometimes gradually, sometimes suddenly – particularly along the [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_lower_oxus_region').GetName]. Locals frequently relocate entire settlements, and foreigners scornfully remark on the filthy conditions in these otherwise prosperous cities due to the flooding."

Even great structures, like the ruins of Al-Fir Citadel of [kath.GetNameNoTier], are not immune to the Mad River’s wrath. I have just heard that the last remnants of Al-Fir have been swept away by the river.\n\nThankfully, the citadel had been more or less deserted for years, so loss of life and devastation to property were minimal.

The so-called “Mad River,” at times, will overflood or change its course unpredictably, negatively affecting the lives of locals.\n\nAs such, there is a tradition among the local [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentNamePlural] to pray at the river every now and then, to ask [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PantheonTerm] to ensure the river flows smoothly this year. However, while some [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] support these practices, other [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] decry these rituals as contrary to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjectiveNoTooltip] doctrine.\n\nAnyways, I’ve just been invited by a prominent [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] to participate in one of these ceremonies.

For example, he praised the quality of the artwork produced by artisans in my realm, or the great devotion some locals had to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName].\n\nHowever, he did have one major problem with my realm, particularly in the settlements near in the [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_lower_oxus_region').GetName] region.\n\n“If I had to be honest,” he told me, “those towns are full of horrible filth! The stench is unbearable! I know it’s no one's fault, as it’s caused by the constant flooding of the Oxus River, but I don’t know how people live with that!”"

The era before Alexander the Great is a long, long time ago, and while we certainly find plenty of ruins of ancient fortresses even in my territory along the Oxus, who can say whether these citadels were originally built by the descendants of Siyavash or not?"
