 harran.0008.desc: "The Temple of the Moon in [harran_county.GetNameNoTier] had stood since time immemorial, a rare reminder of an era long gone. It was as ancient as the Egyptians, already millenniums old by the time Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar lived. It survived calamity after calamity, outliving Empires like the Achaemenids, the Mauryans, and the Romans. It continued to endure even after the rise of the Cross and the Crescent. In an age of war and strife, it was a refuge for the dwindling worshippers of deities as diverse as Hermes, Tammuz, and of course, Sin, an ancient moon deity.\n\nHowever, it has finally met its end. On the orders of [harran_temple_destructor.Custom('TitledFirstName')], the temple has been razed to the ground. The remaining pagans in Harran have lost their temple, and their days are surely numbered."
 harran.0021.desc: "In my dreams, someone of noble appearance approaches me, with hair that is lightly silver, and eyes that are regal and wise. With a tone of gentle authority, [ancient_pagan_philosopher.GetSheHe] introduces [ancient_pagan_philosopher.GetHerselfHimself] as [ancient_pagan_philosopher.Custom('FirstName')], one of the ancient pagan philosophers, though in my dream I don't quite register the importance of this. Regardless, [ancient_pagan_philosopher.GetSheHe] thanks me for all the support I have shown to the Neoplatonic Academy in Harran to ensure its survival."
 harran.0023.desc: "For generations, the Neoplatonic Academy in [harran_county.GetNameNoTier] has been the last vestige of an ancient world. Located in the rugged hills of northern Mesopotamia, its scholars could claim intellectual descent from the Neoplatonists of the Roman Empire, who in turn traced their lineage all the way back to Plato himself. Alas, for years, the Academy suffered from inevitable decline, given how the region was dominated by non-pagans.\n\nHowever, fortune now smiles on the Academy. The wise [harran_academy_reviver.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has pooled together resources to revitalize the Academy by renovating its physical space and attracting many bright scholars to live there. Though it may never rival the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, nor compare to the original Platonic Academy, Harran's Academy now has a guaranteed future as a center of learning."
 harran.0030.desc: "The people of [harran_county.GetNameNoTier] have for centuries been one of the last bastions of ancient, pagan beliefs. Many among them are renowned throughout the region for their knowledge and wisdom. Today, one such man named [spawned_harranian_courtier.Custom('FullName')] has arrived at my court, seeking my patronage. If I support him and his family, he will in exchange provide his services as a scholar and thinker. The Harranians are famed throughout the region for their immense knowledge in all fields - mystical, spiritual, and material - so having one at my court would be a great boon."
 harran.0030.a.tooltip: "As a [harranian_courtier|E], [spawned_harranian_courtier.Custom('FullNameNoTooltip')] might contribute to knowledge in your realm by writing scholarly treatises."
 harran.0031.desc: "The Harranian scholar at my court, [harranian_scholar.Custom('FullName')], has completed writing a scholarly treatise, and has presented me with a copy. The ancient knowledge of the Harranians must be shared with the rest of the world, after all. Regardless, not only will [harranian_scholar.Custom('TitledFirstName')] earn respect from fellow scholars in the region, but I, too, will gain some degree of honor and fame from supporting such a talented individual."
 harran.0040.desc: "[harran_county.GetNameNoTier], which lies in the rugged hills of northern Mesopotamia, has for centuries been a curious relic of ancient times, for its inhabitants are mostly pagan. While they have coexisted peacefully with their Muslim neighbors for years, and are widely respected for their learning, I heard recently of how they have been demanding greater autonomy and freedom. There are those who say it would be wise to allow someone from an influential Harranian family, such as the famed scholar [thabit_ibn_qurra.Custom('FullName')], some degree of power and leadership over Harran."
 harran.0040.a.non_caliph: "I hear [caliph_dude.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is ignoring these recommendations."
 harran.0040.b.caliph: "I agree, and I think [thabit_ibn_qurra.Custom('TitledFirstName')] would be a good leader."
 harran.0040.b.non_caliph: "I hear [caliph_dude.Custom('TitledFirstName')] will grant Harran greater autonomy."
 harran.0040.no_thabit_ibn_qurra_sad: "You will continue playing as [THIS.Char.Custom('TitledFirstName')], and [thabit_ibn_qurra.Custom('FullNameNoTooltip')] will not receive ownership of Harran, meaning there will be no [landed|E] [rulers|E] who are [thabit_ibn_qurra.GetFaith.GetAdjective] anywhere on the map, except for those made through the custom ruler designer."
 harran.0041.desc: "It has been many years since I walked the streets of [harran_county.GetNameNoTier]. Once fertile farmlands grow dusty; people change, grow, die; and life goes on, impermanent as always. But the stars in the sky? They remain, as they always had, and always will. Those who read the stars know that fate can have a mind of its own.\n\nIt is a strange twist of fate that [caliph_dude.Custom('TitledFirstName')] picked me to be Harran's new leader. I had once been ostracized from here, but now I return in triumph. Though I once anticipated that I would forever remain a scholar at the esteemed House of Wisdom, meeting with the greatest minds from all faiths and pouring over ancient tomes of knowledge into the late hours of early morning, the stars set a different course for my life."
 harran.0060.desc: "Today, I am meeting personally with a scholar named [ibn_nabhan.Custom('FullName')]. He hails from an illustrious clan connected to [harran_county.GetNameNoTier], and is descended from famous pagan Harranian scholars like the renowned [thabit_ibn_qurra.Custom('FullName')] and his great-grandson [ibrahim_al_sabi.Custom('FullName')]. Much of his family converted to Islam a generation or two ago, most famously his grandfather [hilal_al_sabi.Custom('FullName')], and he has always claimed the conversion was genuine even though others are skeptical."
 harran.0060.desc.non_caliph: "\n\nAs we engage in a pleasant intellectual chat, I mention a rumor I heard recently. "Is it true that [caliph_dude.Custom('TitledFirstName')] offered to appoint you as headsman of Harran? I imagine it'd be an immense honor given Harran is your family's hometown.""
 harran.0060.no_ibn_nabhan_sad: "You will continue playing as [THIS.Char.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')], and [ibn_nabhan.Custom('FullNameNoTooltip')] will not receive ownership of [harran_county.GetNameNoTier], meaning that even though he is not a [thabit_ibn_qurra.GetFaith.GetAdjective], there would be no [ruler|E] anywhere on the map with a connection to that ancient [faith|E], except for those made through the custom ruler designer."
 harran.0061.desc: "It has been many years since I walked the streets of [harran_county.GetNameNoTier]. Once fertile farmlands grow dusty; people change, grow, die; and life goes on, impermanent as always. But the stars in the sky? They remain, as they always had, and always will. Those who read the stars know that fate can have a mind of its own.\n\nIt is a strange twist of fate that [caliph_dude.Custom('TitledFirstName')]] picked me to be Harran's new leader. The city had been in decline, perhaps correlated with the decline of its ancient pagan community and its scholars.\n\nI pass by the ruins of the old Neoplatonic Academy and then the ruins of the Moon Temple. Kneeling on the ground, I sift through a bit of rubble, and find what remains of the temple's door. I can still make out the words of Plato carved into its wood: “He who knows his own essence becomes divine.”\n\nI read the quote a few times, before looking up to the increasingly dark sky. I gaze at the stars, pretending I could somehow read our fate, before I find my way home."
 harran.0061.a: "I am [ibn_nabhan.Custom('FullNameNoTooltip')], last scion of Harran's ancient pagans."
 harran.0062.desc: "I sit in the darkness of my library, sipping mint tea as my acquaintance enters the room. He is a scholar from the House of Wisdom who I worked with back when I lived in Baghdad, and he gives a smile as he joins me. I offer him some tea, and we chat pleasantly about various topics to catch up.\n\nEventually, our conversation drifts towards the topic of religion. "I heard something interesting about your grandfather [hilal_al_sabi.Custom('FullName')] the other day," my friend tells me.\n\nThis again? I shift uncomfortably, but don't say anything yet, and continue sipping my tea."
 harran.0065.desc: "“But what?” he says.\n\nI frown.\n\n"I don't mean to imply he was secretly an apostate, but…." I consider my words carefully. "I always felt he had sympathy for his birth religion. I could tell by the way he talked fondly of our ancestors."\n\n"The scholarly achievements of Harran's pagans are nothing to laugh at! Your forebear, [thabit_ibn_qurra.Custom('FullName')], was a rare scholar of his age." My friend nods. "But if your grandfather's heart is genuine, thanks to that dream, then that is all that matters. Sure, you still have a few wayward relatives who still believe your old gods, and I know you were never the most pious man, but at least you are a believer, too, right?""
 harran.0066.desc: "Even though it’s been a while, the conversation I had with my scholar friend about my grandfather [hilal_al_sabi.Custom('FullName')] still weighs heavily on my mind. After all, the profound dream is a common theme I hear in other, similar stories of religious conversion.\n\nI only vehemently argue for the sincerity of my grandfather's conversion, perhaps in denial about my own doubts about it, and my own faith.\n\nSince settling in Harran, I have on occasion looked through my family's archives. It is mostly dusty tomes of knowledge, some a century or two old, and a few from the now gone Neoplatonic Academy that once stood in Harran. Today, however, I was sorting through my grandfather desk when I came across a small locked chest I didn't recognize at first."
