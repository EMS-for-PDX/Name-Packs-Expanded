Besides its usual bonuses, it has other special features associated with it.\n\nFirst, its existence is necessary for [harranian_courtiers|E] to spawn in the [courts|E] of Middle Eastern [rulers|E].

Some among us say in this age of new faiths, our prospects of survival as a distinct community are dim. I do not disagree. Time is against us. There are few who practice the ancient ways of peoples like the Egyptians and Greeks.\n\nAs the sun begins to set, I continue walking down the road, and I eventually come to the grand temple in Harran.

Still, Thabit held some degree of influence as the court astronomer and personal friend of Caliph al-Mu'tadid.\n\nThabit's descendants - both pagan and Muslim - would continue to play prominent roles in Islamic intellectual circles well into the 11th century."

Those who read the stars know that fate can have a mind of its own.\n\nIt is a strange twist of fate that [caliph_dude.Custom('TitledFirstName')] picked me to be Harran's new leader. The city had been in decline, perhaps correlated with the decline of its ancient pagan community and its scholars.\n\nI pass by the ruins of the old Neoplatonic Academy and then the ruins of the Moon Temple. Kneeling on the ground, I sift through a bit of rubble, and find what remains of the temple's door. I can still make out the words of Plato carved into its wood: “He who knows his own essence becomes divine.”\n\nI read the quote a few times, before looking up to the increasingly dark sky.

In reality, he was likely a devout Muslim, or at least one who went through the trouble of emphasizing his family's embrace of Islam in his writings, perhaps to address any suspicions that their conversion was not genuine."

He is a scholar from the House of Wisdom who I worked with back when I lived in Baghdad, and he gives a smile as he joins me.

"One of my mentors, an older gentleman, who was acquainted with your grandfather, said he never heard of such a thing, but admits perhaps his memory is not as it used to be thanks to old age. I don’t doubt you, but it does make me wonder if your grandfather was telling the truth - no offense to him.” \n\nI stroke my chin and gaze at my friend quietly. Many question my grandfather's story. I know this.\n\nI ponder how to respond."

Your forebear, [thabit_ibn_qurra.GetFullName], was a rare scholar of his age." My friend nods. "But if your grandfather's heart is genuine, thanks to that dream, then that is all that matters. Sure, you still have a few wayward relatives who still believe your old gods, and I know you were never the most pious man, but at least you are a believer, too, right?""

 harran.0066.desc: "Even though it’s been a while, the conversation I had with my scholar friend about my grandfather [hilal_al_sabi.GetFullName] still weighs heavily on my mind. After all, the profound dream is a common theme I hear in other, similar stories of religious conversion.\n\nI only vehemently argue for the sincerity of my grandfather's conversion, perhaps in denial about my own doubts about it, and my own faith.\n\nSince settling in Harran, I have on occasion looked through my family's archives. It is mostly dusty tomes of knowledge, some a century or two old, and a few from the now gone Neoplatonic Academy that once stood in Harran. Today, however, I was sorting through my grandfather desk when I came across a small locked chest I didn't recognize at first."

I retrieve the key and, with shaking hands, unlock the chest.\n\nMore papers. Of course.\n\nI skim through some of them, and realize these look like personal letters and thoughts my grandfather had about various matters… mostly religious in nature. They are laments about the decline of the [thabit_ibn_qurra.GetFaith.GetAdjective] faith, and my grandfather’s own internal struggle as to where his loyalties were, spiritually."

Please realize the spiritual anguish I felt about my choice of religion - the new faiths of our friends and neighbors, or our forefathers' traditions?\n\nI worry that you, too, may have your doubts one day, so I prepared these writings, as well as my commentaries on various texts, to help guide you towards making the right decision - whatever you choose.\n\nFirst, I suggest you look at my commentary on Plato, which concerns his text on…."
 harran.0068.a: "Thank you, grandfather. I will study these writings."

 harran.0088.t: "Pagan Diversity"
 harran.0088.desc: "The longer I rule over Harran, the more I am amazed at the diversity within the pagans living here. They have survived century after century together, despite their differences in what they worship or how they worship. One would think that this would have led to frequent conflicts, but surprisingly these groups manage to get along - even if there is tension at times. In my discussions with their leaders, it seems that they realize their unique community is stronger and will better endure any hardships if they stick together."
