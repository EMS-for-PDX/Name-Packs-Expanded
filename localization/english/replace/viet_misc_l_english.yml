 game_concept_qi_ma_the_liar_desc: "$game_concept_qi_ma_the_liar$ is an enigmatic traveler who [rulers|E] can sometimes encounter via a random event. Some say he is a deity in earthly form; others say an immortal, cursed by heaven to wander for all eternity, or perhaps members of a long-lived dynasty of adventurers; or perhaps something else.\n\nThough he will never stay for too long, his presence grants access to a special [decision|E] to pay him a visit. He will provide the [ruler|E] with some sagely but oftentimes cryptic advice or thoughts, which will grant them a small boost to one of the five [skills|E].\n\nFor those who do not wish to encounter this figure, he will not appear if the #V Serious Events (Restricted)#! game rule is chosen at game start."
