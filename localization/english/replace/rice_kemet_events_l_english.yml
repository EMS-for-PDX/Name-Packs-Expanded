 VIETkemet.0007.desc: "[khnum_gifter.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has given me a gift today, specifically a beautifully crafted amulet, made of gold, that is dedicated to the god Khnum. As controller of the Nile, he brings fortune to all and is not to be ignored."
 VIETkemet.0013.desc: "[aten_fearer.Custom('TitledFirstName')] claims that while taking a walk today he was by himself and encountered the ghost of Akhenaten himself! This abominable heretic, an incompetent Pharaoh obsessed with the god Aten, caused much mayhem in old Egypt and was rightfully cursed by the priests once the old, true religion was restored. But this is not good news… has [aten_fearer.Custom('FirstName')] been cursed as well?"
