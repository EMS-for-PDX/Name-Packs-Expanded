 # Game Concepts
 game_concept_beaded_crowns: "Beaded Crowns"
 game_concept_beaded_crown: "Beaded Crown"
 game_concept_beaded_crown_desc: "The ruler of $c_ife$, called the Ooni, had and has great religious and secular authority among the Yoruba peoples. Historically, monarchs in the region would travel to $c_ife$ to be crowned by the Ooni with the special beaded crown of Oduduwa, a deity and progenitor of various Yoruba and Edo kings, to legitimize their rule.\n\nIn-game, the Ooni serves as the [head_of_faith|E] of the $west_african_orisha_pagan$ [faith|E]. [rulers|E] who follow a [faith|E] of the $west_african_orisha_religion$ [religion|E], or those in the region who meet other requirements, can take the [decision|E] travel to $c_ife$ to $RICE_niger_delta_request_beaded_crown$. After you select a gift to offer the Ooni, they will decide whether to accept it or reject the gift. If you are the Ooni yourself, you can receive gifts and crown [rulers|E] conversely.\n\nIf you follow a [faith|E] of the $west_african_orisha_religion$ [religion|E], you will be stuck with the [GetModifier('RICE_niger_delta_uncrowned').GetNameWithTooltip] [character_modifier|E] until you get the Ooni to agree to crown you."
 game_concept_niger_delta_craft_guild: "Craft Guild"
 game_concept_niger_delta_craft_guilds: "Craft Guilds"
 game_concept_niger_delta_craft_guilds_desc: "Historically, [rulers|E] in the [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_niger_delta_region').GetName] organized occupational guilds, such as artisanal guilds, under royal patronage to raise their status and control the economy, but in exchange provide these guilds with stable work and political influence.\n\nIf your [culture|E] has either the $tradition_RICE_kinship_based_craft_guilds_name$ or $tradition_RICE_ritual_hegemony_name$ [traditions|E], and you are a [dynast|E], you can take the [decision|E] to $RICE_niger_delta_form_craft_guilds$. There are four to choose from, each with their own requirements: Bronze Casters, Ironsmiths, Ivory and Wood Carvers, and Beadmakers.\n\nEach guild gives your [dynasty|E] a unique [modifier|E], and unlocks the [decision|E] to $RICE_niger_delta_commission_art_from_craft_guilds$ (depending on which guilds your [dynasty|E] has organized). Taking this [decision|E] will let you gain various [artifacts|E], some of which you can [reforge|E] into a [court_artifact|E]."
 game_concept_kola_nut: "Kola Nut"
 game_concept_kola_nuts: "Kola Nuts"
 game_concept_kola_nuts_desc: "Although kola nuts are important throughout Africa, nowhere are they venerated more than among the Igbo people. Thus, [rulers|E] who follow a [faith|E] of the $odinala_religion$ [religion|E] or are of a [culture|E] that has the $tradition_RICE_igwebuike_name$ [tradition|E] have access to two special features related to kola nuts.\n\nFirst, you will have access to a [character_interaction|E] to $RICE_niger_delta_kola_nut_interaction$. This allows you to "pay" another [ruler|E] some [prestige|E] and [piety|E] (depending on your rank) to get a [truce|E].

 niger_delta.0070.desc.intro: "I have received word that the chief priest of Oranmiyan, who serves as the chief [yoruba.GetAdjective] calendar keeper, has decided on the date for this year’s Olojo festival. As arguably the most important festival celebrated in [ife.GetNameNoTier] by the [yoruba.GetName], it commemorates when Ogun, the fierce god of iron and war, cleared the way for the other spirits and deities to enter earth and became an early Ọọ̀ni of [ife.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]."
 niger_delta.0070.desc.ooni: "\n\nAs the Ọọ̀ni, I have an important role to play in this festival, as I will renew my sacred oath as the spiritual leader of all [yoruba.GetName], participate in various rituals, and bless my people. I need to prepare myself and perform various rites and rituals to commune with the ancestors and pray for all my people."
 niger_delta.0070.desc.not_ooni: "\n\nThis year, I’ve made plans to participate in this great event in [ife.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]. As a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], I am expected to participate in a number of rituals alongside the Ọọ̀ni, the spiritual leader of all [yoruba.GetName]."

 niger_delta.0071.desc.intro: "A week before the commencement of the Olojo festival, the Ọọ̀ni is to go into seclusion until the festival starts. In doing so, the Ọọ̀ni can purify themselves in order to ensure the effectiveness of the various rituals and ceremonies they will be partaking in during the Olojo festival."
 niger_delta.0071.desc.ooni: "\n\nI am the current Ọọ̀ni, so it is my duty to follow these sacred traditions without fail. I have retreated into my palace where I am now communing with my ancestors and engaging in nonstop prayer."
 niger_delta.0071.desc.not_ooni: "\n\nThe current Ọọ̀ni, [ooni.Custom('FirstName')], has retreated into [ooni.GetHerHis] palace to commune with [ooni.GetHerHis] ancestors and engage in nonstop prayer. The rest of us who have arrived in [ife.GetNameNoTier] can only wait patiently."
 niger_delta.0071.desc.conclusion: "\n\nWhile this is ongoing, women from the royal household gather each evening to sing praises to Ogun and Oranmiyan, another war deity and ancient Ọọ̀ni, and to sweep the palace to symbolically cleanse it of evil. Meanwhile, the shrine of Ogun in [ife.GetNameNoTier] has been decorated with palm fronds."
 niger_delta.0071.a: "This helps remind everyone that the Olojo festival will start soon."
 niger_delta.0072.t: "Olojo Begins"
 niger_delta.0072.desc.intro: "Today, the Olojo festival begins!\n\nThe first day, Ilagun day, begins well before sunrise, when a search party is sent from the Ọọ̀ni’s palace to find and capture a dog to be sacrificed to Ogun. Ogun is a wrathful deity who claims victims in hunting, war, and accidents on the road, so it is inevitable that this festival dedicated to him begins with such a sacrifice.\n\nThe chief priest of the Olojo festival, the Osogun, leads a procession with the dog in tow to the Ọọ̀ni’s residence in [ife.GetNameNoTier]."
 niger_delta.0072.desc.ooni: "As is tradition, I, as the Ọọ̀ni, do not go out to meet the Osogun. Instead, various chiefs and other powerful rulers who have gathered for the Olojo have been waiting outside the palace in my stead. They give the Osogun a small pot of medicine, and a formal message from myself that the sacrifice to Ogun can proceed."
 niger_delta.0072.desc.not_ooni: "Because Ọọ̀ni [ooni.Custom('FirstName')] is, per tradition, not to go outside to meet the Osogun, the Osogun is instead greeted outside the palace by various chiefs and powerful rulers such as myself, who have gathered for the Olojo. We give the Osogun a small pot of medicine, and a formal message from the Ọọ̀ni that the sacrifice to Ogun can proceed."

 niger_delta.0073.t: "The Sacrifice to Ogun"

Then, invoking Ogun, the Osogun prays for the Ọọ̀ni thusly: “King, owner of sacred power, second only to the gods, may you reign long, may you conquer your enemies!”\n\nThe dog is duly tied and its head smashed with one blow of a club. Once dead, it is tied to the sacred trees to be disemboweled, and its blood to flow forth from the shrine. Prayers and offerings are then made for the Ọọ̀ni and everyone else, as a second dog is sacrificed as well.\n\nWhen the sacrificial ceremonies conclude for the day, everyone starts to make merry, dance, and sing praises to Ogun."

 niger_delta.0074.desc: "On the second day of Olojo, [ife.GetNameNoTier] is still filled with crowds spreading merriment. Several groups stand out in particular.\n\nThe first are the royals, who wear long flowing robes and a hat with a fringe of thread covering their faces, to show all their strong ties to the Ọọ̀ni.\n\nSecond are the medicine men and women, who protect the Ọọ̀ni from evil forces during the festival. They display their medicinal animal horns, and whisper incantations to prevent rain from falling during Olojo.\n\nThird are palace servants, bodies painted in fierce white and red, and accompanied by drummers, who control the crowds with whips.\n\nLast but not least are hunters and blacksmiths, who carry their guilds’ banners."

Most importantly, I renew my oath as Ọọ̀ni.\n\nFollowing this, I go to the shrine of the goddess of wealth, Aje. Though men typically occupy the ritual and public space in [yoruba.GetAdjective] beliefs, women occupy the market space, where crucial business decisions are made, so it is important that I am here to appeal to the spirits for a successful year.\n\nAll in all, these visits reinforce my religious authority.
