Very soon, [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] will retire to their monasteries to focus solely on meditation, study of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetReligion.GetAdjective] scriptures, and more.\n\nLaity such as myself usually take this time to redouble our efforts to live virtuous and moral lives; however, this year, I want to take it to another level. There are some laity who vow to adopt more ascetic practices, such as cutting down on meat and alcohol, and restraining from potentially negative deeds such as sexual misconduct and harming other beings.\n\nI have taken such vows.\n\nOnce Vassa begins, I will abstain from such vices. Hopefully, doing so will help me spiritually."

 magadha.0071.t: "Vassa Begins: Asadha Puja"
 magadha.0071.desc: "Today is the #italic Asadha Puja#!, or Dharma Day, and the first day of Vassa! Dharma Day commemorates the anniversary of when the Buddha set the Wheel of Dharma in motion, by giving his first sermon on the Four Noble Truths: that there is suffering; that suffering is caused by craving; that there is a state beyond suffering and craving, nirvana; and finally, the way to nirvana is through the eightfold path.\n\nAnyways, as usual, I visit a local temple to pay my respect to the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')], listen to their sermons, and engage in prayer. However, this year, I will also be doing my best to abstain from various vices. Surely it won’t be too different from normal life to cut down on excesses."
 magadha.0071.a: "My aspiration is to succeed in this endeavor."

 magadha.0072.t: "Vassa Ends: Kathina"
 magadha.0072.desc: "After three long months, Vassa is over. This year, I took the extra step of adopting more ascetic practices, and trying to abstain from various vices. Whether I succeeded or failed, it is important that I at least tried. There is always room for improvement that I may live a more virtuous and happy life in line with the teachings of the Buddha.\n\nThe end of Vassa is marked by the #italic Kathina#! Festival. Traditionally, parades and ceremonies are held to celebrate the end of the monastics’ retreat, and it is also a time for us laity to give gifts to [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] to show our gratitude. Perhaps I should give a gift of my own to thank them for their efforts, particularly in helping me abstain from vices this year."
 magadha.0072.a: "I do not think giving a gift to them is necessary."
 magadha.0072.b: "I will donate some basic necessities and alms."
 magadha.0072.c: "I will donate new saffron robes, as is tradition."

 magadha.0073.desc.intro: "I have done my best to restrain from vices such as indulging in luxurious food and drink, sexual misconduct, and being unpleasant to others during this Vassa. However, I’m starting to feel the strain from my constant efforts to improve myself."
 magadha.0073.desc.conclusion: "\n\nI should not be misled by distractions and temptations during Vassa - I must focus if I am to overcome my vices!"
 magadha.0073.desc.lustful: "\n\nIn particular, I find it hard to let go of my [GetTrait('lustful').GetName( GetPlayer )] tendencies. It’s always been that way - everywhere I go, I am tempted by the pleasures of the flesh! Ever since Vassa started, I have tried to block out such unwholesome desires, yet even the sight of a little skin will send my imagination running wild with the depraved things I #italic could#! be doing. Sure, beauty is impermanent, and pleasure fleeting, so all my craving might lead me to ruin… but it is so much fun!"
 magadha.0073.desc.greedy: "\n\nIn particular, I find it hard to let go of my [GetTrait('greedy').GetName( GetPlayer )] tendencies. The [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] are clear on this matter. If I am to be a good [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetReligion.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] I must learn to share with others, yet why should I give what belongs to #italic me#! to others, to give them what they don’t deserve? It is true that all things are impermanent - kingdoms rise and fall all the time, after all - so my possessions will be worthless to me in the grand scheme of things, yet it’s still mine… for now."
 magadha.0073.desc.sadistic: "\n\nIn particular, I find it hard to let go of my [GetTrait('sadistic').GetName( GetPlayer )] tendencies. I enjoy seeing others suffer. Others might not see it as a good quality, and perhaps it isn’t, but it is just so… exhilarating. The fear, the suffering, the bloodshed. I know that Emperor Ashoka, the greatest patron of Buddhism in its history, was once a bloodthirsty, brutal man like some claim i am. Somehow he reformed. I don’t know if I want to do the same… yet I must try."
 magadha.0073.desc.callous: "\n\nIn particular, I find it hard to let go of my [GetTrait('callous').GetName( GetPlayer )] tendencies. A lot of people say I don’t care about anyone. Not that I am necessarily cruel (though perhaps I can be, I admit), but I simply am indifferent and cold to others. The Buddha taught us to be kind to all sentient beings. Yet why should I care, when everyone is miserable to begin with? What good will a little kindness do? Maybe I am too focused on myself, and need to reach out to others and be more sensitive to them."
 magadha.0073.desc.vengeful: "\n\nIn particular, I find it hard to let go of my [GetTrait('vengeful').GetName( GetPlayer )] tendencies. I hold grudges easily, and I like to satisfy my thirst for vengeance where possible. Why must I just sit there and suffer, and let others run free despite having wronged me? It isn’t right. Even now, during Vassa, I can’t help but seethe when I think of those fools who dared cross me, and it makes me suffer. Then again… I must have wronged many and caused others to suffer, even if unintentionally. How many people want revenge against me, too?"
 magadha.0073.desc.wrathful: "\n\nIn particular, I find it hard to let go of my [GetTrait('wrathful').GetName( GetPlayer )] tendencies. Everything just irritates me so easily, as someone full of rage. Even during Vassa, I ironically am angry at the fact that I can’t control my anger! How can I ever relax, much less conquer my own vices? The [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetReligion.GetAdjective] scriptures often describe anger like a fire that consumes all. I must learn to take a deep breath, calm myself… yet… I find it so difficult."
 magadha.0073.desc.gluttonous: "\n\nIn particular, I find it hard to let go of my [GetTrait('gluttonous').GetName( GetPlayer )] tendencies. Compared to other vices, enjoying good food and drink isn’t that bad, so why should I feel guilty about it? Restraining myself from harmless fun during Vassa is hard. But it is true what the Buddha said: craving leads to suffering. There must be a balance between indulgence and extreme asceticism, but I do not know if I’ll find this Middle Way the Buddha spoke of, even during Vassa."
 magadha.0073.desc.arrogant: "\n\nIn particular, I find it hard to let go of my [GetTrait('arrogant').GetName( GetPlayer )] tendencies. I mean, who can blame me?There are many out there who simply do not appreciate me for what I do. This Vassa has been annoying, as I try to not boast about my great deeds for no good reason. Then again… perhaps excessive pride leads one to do rather foolish, reckless things. The Buddha urged caution and thoughtfulness in all things. Perhaps… I am focused too much on me, instead of the world around me."
 magadha.0073.desc.impatient: "\n\nIn particular, I find it hard to let go of my [GetTrait('impatient').GetName( GetPlayer )] tendencies. For a long time, it is true my general attitude is that I want things to happen now, now, now. It’s not the worst vice in the world, but now that Vassa is well under way, I find my impatience has been getting the best of me. Why can’t my cravings for luxury go away? Why can’t my idle improper thoughts leave me alone? Maybe I need to take a deep breath, and relax, and realize the world will still continue either way."
 magadha.0073.a: "It will be over soon, so I’ll just get it over with."
 magadha.0073.b: "I’ll focus harder, in the name of the Three Jewels!"

Every day, for now at least, I spend time reading select parts of the #italic Tripitaka#!, the ancient collection of scriptures, to better understand the Buddha’s teachings."
 magadha.0074.a: "Doing this has helped me a lot during Vassa!"
 magadha.0074.b: "Perhaps I should do this regularly even after Vassa…."
 magadha.0075.t: "Aid to Monastics"
 magadha.0075.desc: "During Vassa, it is customary for laity like myself to provide frequent assistance to the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] in our local community. For example, we could take time to provide alms and supplies to them. On the other hand, I #italic do#! want to focus on improving myself, and only have so much time in the world on top of my responsibilities as a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]."
 magadha.0075.a: "It is important to focus on myself during Vassa."
 magadha.0075.b: "I should see if the local [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] need anything."
 magadha.0076.t: "Others' Failures"
 magadha.0076.desc: "This Vassa, I know about other laity who have taken similar vows as myself, to reduce their indulgence in various luxuries, and engage in fruitful behavior. Yet not all of them seem to be taking these vows seriously, and some have failed to abstain from vices the way I am trying to."
 magadha.0076.a: "It is unfortunate, but I can learn from their mistakes."
 magadha.0076.b: "I should focus on myself, not what others do or don’t do."
 magadha.0077.t: "Others' Successes"
 magadha.0077.desc: "This Vassa, I know about other laity who have taken similar vows as myself, to reduce their indulgence in various luxuries, and engage in fruitful behavior.

 magadha.0077.a: "If they can do it, so can I."
 magadha.0078.t: "A Monastery Needs Help"
 magadha.0078.desc: "I have heard one of the local monasteries is short on supplies or food. Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem, as the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] can simply go out to beg for alms.\n\nHowever, during Vassa, [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] are discouraged from traveling outside of monasteries, and there are strict regulations about this. Even if they have a justified reason, it is the responsibility of laity such as myself to assist them so they can focus on their spiritual practice."
 magadha.0078.a: "Why should I get involved?"
 magadha.0078.b: "Give the monastery some alms."
 magadha.0078.c: "Donate a lot to the monastery!"
 magadha.0079.t: "Listening to a Sermon"
 magadha.0079.desc: "Although the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] are mainly focused on meditation, chanting, and other religious practices during Vassa, some will also take time to give sermons to laity such as myself when we visit to give them alms. Today, I attended one such sermon by a famous [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')], who expounded on various topics related to the Buddha’s teachings. Hearing such wise and thoughtful words really helped me in my attempts to restrain from engaging in vice and indulgence."
 magadha.0079.a: "It is good I attended this sermon."
 magadha.0080.t: "Chanting"
 magadha.0080.desc: "Today, as part of Vassa, I am chanting various [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetReligion.GetAdjective] scriptures to myself. It is helping me focus, certainly, so that I may be able to better improve myself spiritually."
 magadha.0080.a: "In the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha…"
 magadha.0081.t: "Can't Find Nothing"
 magadha.0081.desc: "One issue, if I want to call it that, during Vassa is that sometimes it isn’t always easy to buy food and drink. Just as many people try to cut down on excess indulgence during this time, even shopkeepers and merchants will cut down on how much of such indulgent products they sell. Unfortunately, I’m having difficulty buying enough of these products to serve for some upcoming functions and gatherings I’ll be hosting.\n\nNow, given I am not a [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')], it isn’t necessarily a problem if I want to buy some of these things (within reason), especially if it would help me with my various duties and responsibilities as a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]. But I have agreed to abstain from vices this year, or at least reduce them, so perhaps this is an opportunity for me to put that into practice and do what I’d say I’d do…."
 magadha.0081.a: "As a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], I can’t let others see me in squalor."
 magadha.0081.b: "Yes, perhaps I will wait until later to buy these things."
 magadha.0082.t: "Wisdom and Insight"
 magadha.0082.desc: "Some of the local [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] are aware of my vow to abstain from vices during this Vassa, and have commended me for setting an example to the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetReligion.GetAdjective] community, or the Sangha. One [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] in particular, has taken a great interest in providing me pointers and advice on how to manage myself and practice the teachings of the Buddha, on top of the usual responsibilities and duties such a [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] would have during Vassa."
