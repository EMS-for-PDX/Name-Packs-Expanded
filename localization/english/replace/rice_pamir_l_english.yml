 pamir.0005.tooltip.no: "You will continue playing as [THIS.Char.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')]. However, note that the [counties|E] in the [duchy|E] of [badakhshan_duchy.GetNameNoTier] will still split between various petty chieftains who are either Buddhist or pagan."
 pamir.0005.tooltip.azur_jamshid: "You will choose to play as [azur_jamshid.Custom('TitledFirstName')], the legendary fairy price and savior of Gilgit."
 pamir.0008.desc: "The lands of Khorasan have fallen under the dominion of two powerful Turkic dynasties, the Seljuks and the Ghaznavids. However, their authority is weak in the highlands of the Pamir and Hindu Kush mountains, where fierce, independent tribes and warlords dwell among the valleys and mountain passes. For generations, this region has been a kaladiascope of different faiths, cultures, and languages.\n\nIn [badakhshan_duchy.GetNameNoTier], I have heard there dwells a wise and revered Muslim holy man known as [nasir_khusraw.Custom('FullName')]. His patron and long-time friend is the righteous and erudite [ali_ibn_asad.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')], who shares mutual interests in spiritual and philosophical matters.\n\nAnyways, who knows what else lies in store for the future of the Pamirs?"
 pamir.0008.a: "As [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitledFirstName')], I have a stake in this region's future."
 pamir.0008.b: "My story is with the intellectual [ali_ibn_asad.Custom('TitledFirstName')]…."
 pamir.0008.tooltip.no: "You will continue playing as [THIS.Char.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')]. However, note that [badakhshan_duchy.GetNameNoTier] will still be owned by [ali_ibn_asad.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')]."
 pamir.0008.tooltip.yes: "The [duchy|E] of [badakhshan_duchy.GetNameNoTier] is ruled by the intelligent [ali_ibn_asad.Custom('TitledFirstNameNoTooltip')]. If you choose to play as him, will you be able to assist your friend and mentor [nasir_khusraw|E] in bringing the light of Islam to these lands?"
 pamir.0008.tooltip.kayani: "The territories near [gilgit_county.GetNameNoTier] are ruled by [nur_kayani.Custom('TitledFirstName')], descendant of the legendary hero Azur Jamshid. Can he carry on his forefathers' legacy?"
 pamir.0009.desc: "I am [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitledFirstName')], ruler of the remote mountains and valleys of [badakhshan_duchy.GetNameNoTier], the frontier of #italic Dar al-Islam#! that borders the #italic kafir#! lands of Hindustan and Tibet. Many here still cling to their old idolatrous ways. Still, I've gained a reputation for being an intellectual, open-minded ruler.\n\nFor instance, my friend [nasir_khusraw.Custom('FullName')] has faced hardship after hardship in the lands of other Muslim rulers, depsite being respected by both Shiite and Sunni commoners as a righteous holy man; these warlords see his [nasir_khusraw.GetFaith.GetAdjective] creed as heresy. I saw differently, and gave him refuge in my lands.\n\nSince his arrival, we’ve had many wonderful intellectual exchanges. I feel he is the man who will bring the light of Islam to this land. So much, in fact, I cannot help but wonder if my current [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] beliefs are right. Perhaps the [nasir_khusraw.GetFaith.GetAdjective] truth is what I’ve been seeking all along."
 pamir.0009.a: "I respect my friend, [nasir_khusraw.Custom('FullName')], but our views on faith differ."
 pamir.0009.b: "[nasir_khusraw.Custom('FullName')] has shown me the light! I must change my ways."
 pamir.0013.desc: "[gilgit_county.GetNameNoTier] is a land of great beauty and abundance, but for many years, it was tarnished by the excessive cruelties of [shri_badat.Custom('TitledFirstName')], known as #italic Adam Khor#!, the Man-Eater. I was but one of many adventurers from Iran, who sought to escape his past and seek refuge from our Arab overlords; in the end, I arrived at the right place and the right time, for who can resist the tide of destiny? Somehow, now, I sit on the throne of [gilgit_county.GetNameNoTier], having been proclaimed its new ruler."
 pamir.0014.desc: "When I first arrived in [gilgit_county.GetNameNoTier], I tried to live as a humble laborer, a far cry from my noble origins. My past was my past; here, I would live a new, and simple life. But fate has its ways.\n\n[nur_bakht.Custom('TitledFirstName')], the daughter of [shri_badat.Custom('TitledFirstName')], fell in love with me, and I returned her affections. Unlike her father, she is pure of heart. The people eventually learned of my origins (and some even believe that I am a fairy prince from the sky on account!) and pleaded with me to deliver them from the oppression of [shri_badat.Custom('TitledFirstName')]. Even his own minister, [jataylotu.Custom('TitledFirstName')], approached me!"
 pamir.0015.desc: "Though I was reluctant to play the hero, we all worked together to kill [shri_badat.Custom('TitledFirstName')] and end his reign of tyranny once and for all. Some superstitious peasants believe their former king has witch-like powers, and is alive and in hiding, but for now, a new day dawns on [gilgit_county.GetNameNoTier]. Alas, it suffered greatly from its previous ruler, and its infrastructure and economy in shambles. I confess this is a land and peoples I have much to learn about; after the initial euphoria wears off, I must earn the people’s trust so we can work together to restore [gilgit_county.GetNameNoTier] to its former glory."
 pamir.0016.desc: "Generations ago, my ancestor [azur_jamshid.Custom('TitledFirstName')] vanquished the cruel, cannibal king [shri_badat.Custom('TitledFirstName')] and established a new ruling dynasty here in [gilgit_county.GetNameNoTier]. People still esteem my ancestor greatly, as celebrations are regularly held to commemorate his overthrow of the tyrant. Times are changing, however, with the coming of powerful Turkic nomads from west of the Pamir and Hindu Kush mountains, such as the Seljuks or the Ghaznavids. We must tread carefully if we are to survive."
 pamir.0020.desc: "A warrior named [RICE_burusho_warrior_spawn.Custom('TitledFirstName')], who hails from a Burusho clan, has arrived at my court to offer me his services. The Burusho, also known as the Hunza, live in the valleys of our territories in the Pamir and Karakoram Mountains and speak a unique language unlike any other. They are an isolated people who mostly keep to themselves, but are known as fierce if stubborn warriors."

Their names are [RICE_burusho_courtier_spawn_1.Custom('TitledFirstName')] and [RICE_burusho_courtier_spawn_2.Custom('TitledFirstName')]. The Burusho, also known as the Hunza, live in the valleys of our territories in the Pamir and Karakoram Mountains and speak a unique language unlike any other.

 pamir.0022.desc: "A pagan warrior named [RICE_kafir_warrior_spawn.Custom('TitledFirstName')], who is from one of the tribes of so-called Kafiristan (the land of infidels), a mountainous region in between Afghanistan and Kashmir, has arrived at my court to offer his services. These tribes that inhabit these pristine valleys and highlands are notorious for their fierce resistance against any influence or occupation by the followers of other religions, whether Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, Zoroastrian, and otherwise. It might be useful to have a warrior from one such tribe serving me."

These tribes that inhabit these pristine valleys and highlands are notorious for their fierce resistance against any influence or occupation by the followers of other religions, whether Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, Zoroastrian, and otherwise. It might be useful to have contacts from one such tribe serving me."
 pamir.0024.desc: "A warrior named [RICE_brahui_warrior_spawn.Custom('TitledFirstName')], who hails from a Brahui clan, arrives at my court to offer me his services. The Brahui, are a group of mostly nomadic or semi-nomadic tribes who purportedly migrated to Balochistan generations ago. They are a divided, decentralized group who are not unified under any leader, though they do sometimes interact with the more settled peoples around them. It might be useful to have a warrior from one such tribe serving me."

 pamir.0035.desc: "According to our traditional [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] beliefs, goats are held in high regard, sacred even, for they represent purity. That is not to mention the importance of goats to our survival and our prosperity. Therefore, to sacrifice a goat to the heavens is perhaps the greatest sacrifice I could perform, even as a [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsName')]. First, I need to decide how many goats I will sacrifice - after all, the bigger the sacrifice, the more devotion I am showing to the heavens, no?"

 pamir.0040.desc: "Centuries ago, the Idol of Zun stood proudly in [zamindawar_county.GetNameNoTier] as a symbol of Zun, and the devotion and piety of his followers. Now, the great golden statue, adorned with eyes of ruby from Badakhshan, has been resurrected thanks to the efforts of [zun_idol_restorer.Custom('TitledFirstName')] - surely a sign of the revival of [zun_idol_restorer.GetFaith.GetAdjective] fortunes!"
 pamir.0041.desc: "Ages ago, Mount Aruna, which is near [kabul_county.GetNameNoTier], was said to have been an abode for the great god Zun, the Justice-Giver. Alas, his followers were chased off the mountain by Brahamnist followers of Surya. However, thanks to the efforts of [zun_mount_aruna_relcaimer.Custom('TitledFirstName')], Mount Aruna is now firmly under [zun_mount_aruna_relcaimer.GetFaith.GetAdjective] control once more, and a new Idol of Zun has been erected there."
 pamir.0043.desc.generic: "Though [shri_badat.Custom('TitledFirstName')] is no more, the legacy of this foul, cannibal tyrant still poisons the land. His palace, the site of his unnatural, gruesome feasts, remains standing in [gilgit_county.GetNameNoTier]. But no more!\n\nI have brought together a number of local peasants, and ordered them to bring torches, shovels, hammers, and whatever instruments they could find. Once enough had gathered, with a great hearty cheer, we marched to the palace and promptly tore it down with our tools."
 pamir.0043.desc.azur_jamshid: "Though I righteously killed [shri_badat.Custom('TitledFirstName')], the legacy of this foul, cannibal tyrant still poisons the land. His palace, the site of his unnatural, gruesome feasts, remains standing in [gilgit_county.GetNameNoTier]. But no more!\n\nI have brought together a number of local peasants, and ordered them to bring torches, shovels, hammers, and whatever instruments they could find. Once enough had gathered, with a great hearty cheer, we marched to the palace and promptly tore it down with our tools.\n\nTogether with my lovely wife [nur_bakht.Custom('TitledFirstName')], we watched as the palace burned. Though this whole affair saddens her, as [shri_badat.Custom('TitledFirstName')] was her father after all, she tells me she understands it had to be done."
 pamir.0045.desc: "I have decided that it is time I show my devotion to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], in the traditional [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] manner, by offering the Justice-Giver’s idol some amount of priceless items. I will need to prepare for my trip to the idol - it must be a grand ceremony, after all, given I am a [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')]."

 pamir.0055.desc: "At the end of the Chinir Festival, it is customary to symbolically assist in the harvesting of crops, even if one isn’t a farmer. After all, it is important that everyone shows their bonds with the community, even I, a [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')], should partake in this. It isn’t like I am doing real farmwork, anyways."

 pamir.0059.b: "This belongs to me! I’m the [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')]!"

 pamir.0101.desc: "I have received word that the great [nasir_khusraw.Custom('FullName')] has just passed away. He was not only an eloquent poet and a brilliant scholar, but also a holy man who sought to spread the light of Islam (and specifically that of the [nasir_khusraw.GetFaith.GetAdjective] sect) to the lands of [badakhshan_duchy.GetNameNoTier] in eastern Afghanistan. Because of this, he was revered by both Shiite and Sunni Muslims alike.\n\nAs [nasir_khusraw.Custom('FullName')] lived as a hermit not too far from the hamlet of Yamgan in [badakhshan_county.GetNameNoTier] for much of his later life, his followers have brought his body there to be buried. They are erecting a small shrine in his honor, and word has already spread far and wide about pilgrims who wish to travel to Yamgan to pay their respects to this beloved holy man."

 pamir.0102.desc: "Ever since the great [nasir_khusraw.Custom('FullName')] passed away, a small but dedicated cohort of Muslims hailing from all sects, both Shia and Sunni, have flocked to his tomb to pay their respects to this poet, scholar, and holy man. There, these pilgrims find inspiration to become closer to Allah through his example. His tomb is near the hamlet of Yamgan, which lies within my territories in [badakhshan_county.GetNameNoTier].\n\nBecause of that, I have decided to dedicate some funds to the construction of a humble but well-built shrine around his tomb. Now, he’ll have a proper resting place, and one suitable for someone like him. This should bring in even more pilgrims to the area and help stimulate the local economy, and, of course, it does not hurt to honor this holy man either way."

 RICE_pamir_enable_nasir_khusraw_pilgrimage_desc: "Muslims living in or near [badakhshan_county.GetNameNoTier] can now take a [decision|E] to [go_on_a_pilgrimage_to_nasir_khusraws_shrine|E]."

 pamir.0103.desc: "Ever since the great [nasir_khusraw.Custom('FullName')] passed away, a small but dedicated cohort of Muslims hailing from all sects, both Shia and Sunni, have flocked to his tomb to pay their respects to this poet, scholar, and holy man. There, these pilgrims find inspiration to become closer to Allah through his example. His tomb is located near the small hamlet of Yamgan which lies in [badakhshan_county.GetNameNoTier], currently ruled by [badakhshan_ruler.Custom('TitledFirstName')].\n\nWhether out of genuine admiration for Nasir Khusraw, or as a cynical ploy, [badakhshan_ruler.Custom('TitledFirstName')] has decided to dedicate some funds to the construction of a humble but well-built shrine around Nasir Khusraw’s tomb. That way, he will have a proper resting place, one suitable for a revered holy man like him."

 pamir.0104.desc: "Recently, I keep thinking about this long poem I read a long time ago. Written by an obscure Persian intellectual named Abu al-Haytham al-Jurjani, it poses a series of thoughtful and challenging questions about religion and philosophy, and it is making me reconsider my own beliefs. In particular, though I consider myself an educated person, I have difficulty reconciling the issues between religion and classical philosophy that the poem discusses.\n\nI decide to approach [nasir_khusraw.Custom('FullName')] about this matter, for everyone knows he is full of wisdom and brilliant insight. In fact, I told him that I was willing to commission him to write a response to Al-Jurjani’s poem. To my relief, he said he was willing to do such a thing."

 pamir.0106.opening: "To the intellectual [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsName')] [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitledFirstName')]:"

 pamir.0113.desc: "For years, I heard about a Muslim holy man known as [nasir_khusraw.Custom('FullName')], who traveled from realm to realm seeking shelter. Though a great poet and scholar, famous throughout the Islamic world for his achievements, he was the target of sectarian rulers, and never found a proper home - until now.\n\nI have received news that has arrived in the Badakhshan region, and made a home for himself there in the rugged, isolated parts of [nasir_khusraw_county.GetNameNoTier] in particular. It appears he has found himself a friend and patron in the righteous and erudite [nasir_khusraw_buddy.Custom('TitledFirstName')], who appreciates the spiritual and philosophical insights of [nasir_khusraw.Custom('FullName')]. \n\nTo imagine that such a famous personage now graces his presence in this remote part of the world! Now, [nasir_khusraw.Custom('FullName')] wishes to spread the light of Islam there - can he succeed?"
 pamir.0113.tooltip: "Will [nasir_khusraw_buddy.Custom('TitledFirstName')] be able to assist [nasir_khusraw_buddy.GetHerHis] friend and mentor [nasir_khusraw|E] in bringing the light of Islam to Badakhshan? Only time will tell."

 pamir.0115.desc: "[azur_jamshid.Custom('TitledFirstName')], the fairy prince and savior of [gilgit_county.GetNameNoTier], is no more, as he has recently passed away. Years ago, he led the people of [gilgit_county.GetNameNoTier] to a better and brighter future when they overthrew and killed the cannibal tyrant, king [shri_badat.Custom('TitledFirstName')]. However, though he is no longer here, it is likely the locals will continue celebrating his legacy for generations to come."

 pamir.0115.tooltip: "With the passing of [azur_jamshid|E], if or once the [county_modifier|E] #N Shri Badat’s Palace#! has been removed via the [decision|E] to #V Raze Shri Badat’s Palace#! as well, [rulers|E] in the [duchies|E] of #V Pamir#! and #V Ladakh#! can take a [decision|E] to #V Sponsor the Tumshiling Festival#!."

 pamir.0130.desc: "I have started making plans to take a short, more modest local pilgrimage to the hamlet of Yamgan in [badakhshan_county.GetNameNoTier]. In truth, I am not headed to Yamgan itself, but rather to a shrine near it - the shrine that houses the tomb of the famed [nasir_khusraw.Custom('FullName')], the great poet, scholar, and holy man. In Badakhshan and many parts of around the Pamirs, though he was a proselytizer of the Ismaili sect in his lifetime, he is still revered by both Shiite and Sunni Muslims in the region. Many here take the opportunity to visit his shrine, and I aim to do likewise."

 pamir.0131.desc: "I have finished preparing for my trip to the shrine of [nasir_khusraw.Custom('FullName')]. I bid my household farewell, and begin the journey through the Pamir mountains.\n\nMy destination? Yamgan, in [badakhshan_county.GetNameNoTier].\n\nI hope that by visiting this great man’s shrine, and emulating his example, I can strengthen my faith and become closer to Allah."

 pamir.0136.desc: "I emerge from the shrine, with my body invigorated and my mind buzzing with inspiration and joy. Now, I start preparing to go home.\n\nHowever, I remember how it is customary that when wealthy or powerful patrons visit the shrine of Nasir Khusraw, they give alms and share food with other pilgrims (especially those less fortunate than them) in honor of their visit before they leave. As a [ROOT.Char.Custom('TitleAsNameNoTooltip')], perhaps I should take this opportunity to provide charity before I depart from here."
 pamir.0136.a: "I will do the obligatory amount of alms and sharing."
 pamir.0136.b: "Yes! I will donate as much as I can to everyone here."
 pamir.0136.c: "Why should I? I’ve already done enough charity."
 pamir.0137.t: "Returning Home"
 pamir.0137.desc: "After some more time trekking through the rugged wilderness of the Pamirs, I have returned from my pilgrimage to the shrine and tomb of [nasir_khusraw.Custom('FullName')]. I learned and experienced so much, and will certainly not forget this experience anytime soon."
 pamir.0137.a: "Such is the will of Allah! It was well worth it."
 pamir.0150.t: "Organizing for Chawmos"
 pamir.0150.desc: "The winter solstice is nearly upon us, which means it is almost time to celebrate the Chawmos Festival. As a devotee of the gods, in the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] manner, it is important for me to participate in this event, for it is a sacred time of year, when we perform the necessary rituals to guide this year into the next, and to proper delineate that which is pure and that which is impure.\n\nI and other community leaders will gather the people of the nearby towns, and together, we will work hard to prepare a grand Chawmos for this year. Ultimately, despite the fun that we may and will have, we must take all of this seriously, and do our best to ensure the event is a spiritual success."
 pamir.0150.a: "Let’s get to work."
 pamir.0151.t: "Bandek"
 pamir.0151.desc: "Preparations for this year’s Chawmos are underway, but as is custom, I and several other prominent locals need to partake in the #italic Bandek#! ritual. Inevitably, people pass away during the course of the year, and the #italic Bandek#! is the opportunity for us to ritually invite relatives of the deceased to end their period of mourning, and rejoin the community. I will need to spend some time going door to door to some of these locals’ houses, and formally requesting them to join Chawmos."
 pamir.0151.a: "Let’s go without delay! Doing this is integral to the Chawmos’ success."
 pamir.0151.b: "I don’t need to greet peasants - other local leaders can go in my stead."
 pamir.0152.t: "Sarazari"
 pamir.0152.desc: "Chawmos officially begins with the #italic Sarazari#! ritual, which revolves around juniper, the sacred plant used in many of our purification rituals. I, as well as other nobles, villagers, travelers, and [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')], and others have gathered at a designated location to witness the #italic Sarazari#!. During this ritual, young boys and girls separate into two groups based on gender, and light the juniper branches in a competition to see who can create the most amount of smoke, all of which is dedicated to the god Balumain."
 pamir.0152.desc.boy: "\n\nThis year, it seems the boys have won, as the smoke they made is clearly more so than the girls’! After #italic Sarazari#! Is done, the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] hold juniper branches and offer prayers.

 pamir.0153.desc: "Today is #italic Kuta’mru#!, an important day when the realms of the wilderness and civilization are most spiritually connected.\n\nIn the morning, children gather around the local temple for the #italic Chutayak#! ritual, where they paint the temple’s walls, doors, and columns with images of mountains, stars, various animals, and more. This is all done in complete silence.\n\nIn the afternoon, everyone focuses on making sculptures out of flour. These will be baked and displayed out in the pastures early next morning to symbolize their migration to the fields to graze, before they are sold to non-believers as we are not allowed to eat them. Typically, the sculptures depict shepherds or various animals; what shall I focus on sculpting this year?"

 pamir.0154.t: "Madahik"
 pamir.0154.desc: "The next ritual in the Chawmos cycle is #italic Madahik#!, the day when we commemorate our dead ancestors. Outside the temple, we prepare a miniature wooden fortress called the #italic Chilikotik#!, where we place many items of food. After this tower of food is lit, we all hurry into the temple, to allow the ancestors time and space to visit. Inside the temple, an elder calls out, “Oh elders, come eat and drink, then leave.”\n\nOnce enough time has passed, we emerge from the temple. Outside, the #italic Chilikotik#! and all the food is completely burnt into ashes."

 pamir.0155.desc: "It is time for the ritual of #italic Sawelik Hari#!, where we are expected to be rid of useless old possessions, and replace them with new ones. More entertainingly, it is time for a theatrical performance that satirizes the recent events of the previous year. Everyone roars with laughter as various community members are made fun of (all in good humor, of course). Earlier, when we were organizing the Chawmos festival, what did we agree on would be the theme of this year’s performance?"
 pamir.0155.a: "Various deeds (or misdeeds) I have accomplished"
 pamir.0155.b: "The trivial things that happen in the local villagers’ lives"
 pamir.0155.c: "News of grand events that occurred far away"
 pamir.0156.t: "Goshnik"
 pamir.0156.desc: "Today is #italic Goshnik#!, a crucial part of the Chawmos cycle, for today is the day we formally welcome children into our community, as practicing members of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] faith.\n\nBoys and girls around seven or eight years of age go through the #italic Chailaksambaik#!, where they put on traditional tunics and animals are sacrificed to them; the blood of these animals are sprinkled on the boys. Older boys, instead, go through a similar ritual called the the #italic Butsambaik#!."
 pamir.0156.desc.child: "\n\nAmong the children this year is my own progeny! Now, along with the other children, they all have been truly welcomed into our religion!"

 pamir.0157.desc: "Tonight is the night of #italic Ghona Chanja#!, where the god Balumain comes from [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DivineRealm] on his heavenly steed to bless us. Though he is not the chief god, he is our divine protector who taught us the proper rituals aeons ago.\n\nAt midnight, we go to a high point near the village where stands a special altar, the #italic indraine#!. There, we offer Balumain food and animal sacrifices, as the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] leads us in prayers. What shall I ask Balumain to help me with?"

Foxes are cunning animals, who are responsible for a year’s fortunes and misfortunes. As part of this ritual, young men begin to scour the nearby hills and forests in the early morning for foxes, playing loud drums and music near the caves the foxes live in to entice them to come out. If the first fox they see runs uphill, to the pure abode of the mountains, then good fortune shall befall on all the following year; if it runs downhill, then there shall be misfortune. If no fox is found… then perhaps they were too clever for us this year."

While there is food and dance, there is one performance that takes center stage.\n\nIn the middle of the village square, many individuals have covered their faces. Not only that, many of them, masked or not, are dressed as the opposite gender: some men are dressed as women, and some women are dressed as men. Meanwhile, the men have been divided into two groups; the “pure” men sing solemn and honored songs of the past, while the “impure” men sing obscene melodies with wild rhythms. This, truly, is the culmination of the Chawmos: when the boundaries of the realms are broken down before they are rebuilt."
 pamir.0159.a: "Wonderful!"
 pamir.0160.t: "Chawmos Ends"
 pamir.0160.desc: "At long last, all of the rituals of Chawmos have been properly performed, and the weeks-long celebrations come to a close. What memories we’ve all made! The new year is upon us, and let us hope it proves to be a decent one."
 pamir.0160.a: "Until next time."
 pamir.0180.t: "Preparing for Tumshiling"
 pamir.0180.desc: "Although the Tumshiling Festival is regularly held in the early winter every year, I believe it is time I officially sponsored one of these celebrations at a nearby village. For those who live in the high reaches of the Pamir region, particularly near [gilgit_county.GetNameNoTier], it is an important event to commemorate the legend of the heroic [azur_jamshid.Custom('TitledFirstName')], and how he overthrew the cannibal tyrant [shri_badat.Custom('TitledFirstName')] who once ruled and oppressed the people of [gilgit_county.GetNameNoTier]."
 pamir.0180.a: "Let us prepare!"
 pamir.0181.t: "Tumshiling Begins"
 pamir.0181.desc: "The Tumshiling Festival is almost upon us! Several days before it starts, the meat provisions for winter have been laid to dry. Although the festival celebrates the triumph of [azur_jamshid.Custom('TitledFirstName')] over [shri_badat.Custom('TitledFirstName')] in [gilgit_county.GetNameNoTier], it is also an important ritual to ensure the local villagers have enough food to survive the winter."
 pamir.0181.a: "I hope this winter will not be too harsh on us."
 pamir.0182.t: "The Great Bonfire"
 pamir.0182.desc: "Finally, today - or rather tonight - is the Tumshiling Festival. As soon as the sun sets, many men pour from the village, holding torches and playing music, and throw them into a large bonfire.\n\nAccording to legend, the cruel [shri_badat.Custom('TitledFirstName')] had a heart made of butter, so to defeat him, [azur_jamshid.Custom('TitledFirstName')] and the locals gathered many torches and piled them around the palace [shri_badat.Custom('TitledFirstName')] lived in to destroy his heart. Some say this killed the tyrant, but many others say this merely weakened him, and he hides in one of these valleys, using foul magic to curse the population every now and then, which is why re-enacting this event is necessary."
 pamir.0182.a: "Who knows if he is still around?"
 pamir.0183.t: "Singing and Celebrations"
 pamir.0183.desc: "As we all watch in satisfaction as the great bonfire burn, the villagers begin to sing various songs about the victory of [azur_jamshid.Custom('TitledFirstName')] over [shri_badat.Custom('TitledFirstName')], some of which supposedly date back to that time. For example, there is one song said to have been sung by a villager when he and the other commoners were instructed by [azur_jamshid.Custom('TitledFirstName')] to destroy the palace of [shri_badat.Custom('TitledFirstName')]:\n\n#italic ’My nature is of a hard metal,’ once said Shri Badat.\nBut I, Khoto, the son of the peasant Dem Singh, alone am hardy;\nwith this iron spade I raze to the ground thy kingly house.\nBehold now, although thou art of race accursed, of\nI, Dem Singh’s son, am of hard metal;\nfor with this iron spade I level thy very palace;\nlook out! look out!#!"

 pamir.0200.t: "Juniper"
 pamir.0200.desc: "I and my entourage got lost for a bit in a forest while traveling in the Pamir and Hindu Kush Mountains in my realm. However, on the bright side, we did come across large numbers of juniper, which grows in many places in this region. I decided to collect some to use for various religious and herbal uses."
 pamir.0200.a: "In a way, it was good we got lost."
 pamir.0201.t: "Hunters"
 pamir.0201.desc: "There are parts of the Pamir plateau that are so rugged that they have no human inhabitants, and are only visited by hunters from nearby local villages. Two hunters recently got into a scuffle in one of these remote regions, and claim the other stole each other’s quarry. It has been brought to my attention, and they hope I can make a ruling on the matter."
 pamir.0201.a: "The hunter from the north has a more convincing case."
 pamir.0201.b: "The hunter from the south has a more convincing case."

 pamir.0201.d: "I have no time for dealing with these commoners’ problems."
 pamir.0202.t: "Lapis Lazuli"
 pamir.0202.desc: "Ah, lapis lazuli, the precious blue stone, valued since ancient times! The majority of the world’s supply comes from Badakhshan in the Pamir Plateau, so locals will often present me gifts of tribute in the form of raw lapis lazuli, as they have today."
 pamir.0202.a: "The gift is much appreciated."
 pamir.0203.t: "Sar-i Sang"
 pamir.0203.desc: "Today I am inspecting the lapis lazuli mines of Sar-i Sang, a source of much wealth for the region. Some of the miners have recently said the taskmasters are ruthless and overwork them, even causing unnecessary injuries among the workers in some cases. With nowhere to turn to, they appeal to me. Both sides present their cases, but both sides are convincing, alas."
 pamir.0203.a: "I say the taskmasters are in the wrong. You can’t overwork people."
 pamir.0203.b: "Clearly the miners are wrong. They are lazy and want less work!"

 pamir.0204.t: "Kuh-i Lal"
 pamir.0204.desc: "Today I am inspecting the ruby mines of Kuh-i Lal, a source of much wealth for the region.

 pamir.0207.t: "Pamir Hot Springs"
 pamir.0207.desc: "The Pamir Plateau is host to a number of hot springs, and I decided to go visit one of the lesser-known ones today that aren't as popular, even among the locals, mainly so I could be undisturbed. It was really relaxing, and helped take my mind of things, if only for a little while."
 pamir.0207.a: "I am glad to have made the trip."
 pamir.0208.t: "A Beautiful Lake"
 pamir.0208.desc: "Though it may be hard for some to imagine, picturesque lakes can be found in the pristine Pamir and Hindu Kush Mountains. I came across one today while traveling to someplace in my realm’s territories in these highlands. The lake is of the bluest color, like lapis lazuli or the sky, and surrounded by a gorgeous visage of flora."
 pamir.0208.a: "Such are the wonders of nature!"
 pamir.0209.t: "Petroglyphs"
 pamir.0209.desc: "Petroglyphs are a common sight in the Pamir and Hindu Kush Mountains. People have passed through this region for centuries, so it’s unsurprising that I’ve come across one in my travels. This one appears to have drawings of hunters, animals, and various aspects of nature like the sun and the trees. Despite its simplicity, there is a timeless charm to it."

 pamir.0210.t: "Undecipherable"
 pamir.0210.desc: "Petroglyphs are a common sight in the Pamir and Hindu Kush Mountains.

It also includes a few inscriptions in a language none of us recognize."
 pamir.0210.a: "The text is worn out, so it’s hard to read either way."
 pamir.0211.t: "Wakhan"
 pamir.0211.desc: "The Wakhan Corridor is one of the most remote yet awe-inspiring places on this earth, it must seem. While passing through it today to travel to one of my realm’s settlements, I saw above me a sky of palest blue. In front of me, an endless stretch of green and fawn colored plain. At my sides, two imposing, ancient rows of mountains that flanked the valley."
 pamir.0211.a: "So many passed through here over the centuries…."
 pamir.0212.t: "Nomads in the Pamirs"
 pamir.0212.desc: "Several clans of nomads have recently moved into one of the valleys in [nomad_county.GetNameNoTier]. This isn’t an uncommon occurrence, as the summer pastures of the region are often attractive destinations for these nomads. Sometimes, the settled locals are fine with this and may even befriend the nomads. Other times, conflict arises between the two groups."
 pamir.0212.a: "Hopefully things go well this time."

 pamir.0213.desc: "A clan of nomads have moved into a part of the Pamir Plateau under my jurisdiction, specifically in [nomad_county.GetNameNoTier]. There are plenty of summer pastures there that typically attract these kinds of nomads. While this happens frequently, this clan of nomads is experienced in war, and have offered you their services as warriors under me service. It is an appealing offer, if not one that might be questioned by skeptical locals."
 pamir.0213.a: "They can serve me as an auxiliary unit in my forces."
 pamir.0213.b: "Better they be a local militia who can train my troops."

 pamir.0215.t: "Big Horns"
 pamir.0215.desc: "I am traveling through a part of my domain in the Pamir Mountains, and am resting for a while at the residence of one of the local shepards. He happily discusses with me his flock of the local breed of sheep, called #italic nakhjipar#! or #italic ramapoy#! in the local tongues, which are known for their big horns. These are so big that the pen he uses to enclose his flock is made using these horns!"

 pamir.0216.t: "Burusho Feuds"
 pamir.0216.desc: "The Burusho - a small but powerful group of peoples in the Pamir Plateau - are famed for their fighting prowess. Unfortunately, two Burusho clans in my territories - specifically in [burusho_county.GetNameNoTier] - are starting to engage in the feud.

He supplicated before me, and offered me half of his bread, known as #italic diram fitti#!, the traditional sweet tasting wheat bread of the Burusho, mixed with a little butter. It was all he had other than his clothes on his back."

It is made using  #italic rush-kakht#!, a rare type of red wheat that only grows in specific parts of the Pamir mountains. It tastes sweet, in a subtle yet rich manner, but due to the rarity of this kind of wheat, it will not be cheap for my cooks to make it."

Everyone in the village, man and woman, young and old, shares its #italic huk#!. Differences in #italic huk#! explain why the people of our village are gentle, intelligent, and polite, but those of the village downstream are rude, brash, and angry.”"
