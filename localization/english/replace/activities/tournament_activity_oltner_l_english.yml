"I am [liegeless_knight.Custom('FullName')], a $knight_culture_player_no_tooltip_lowercase$ seeking employment. I am [liegeless_knight.Custom('FormalComplimentAdjective')], [liegeless_knight.Custom('ComplimentAdjective')], loyal, and my house is strong — #EMP [liegeless_knight.GetHouse.GetMotto]!#!"

[strongman_1.GetSheHe] screams before lifting [strongman_1.GetHerHis] opponent and slamming [strongman_1.GetHerHim] into the ground — making [strongman_2.GetHerHim] yield immediately.

Three peasants in particular seem to be sharing what looks like an #EMP entire keg#! of [tournament_host.Custom('RegionalDrink')].\n\n"Ahwi... ahwigetcha' for 'dat, you [peasant_2.Custom('InsultNoun')]!" one sputters drunkenly, limply throwing [peasant_1.Custom('ThrowableObjectArticle')] at [peasant_1.GetHerHis] neighbor.\n\n"[peasant_1.Custom('FirstName')], ahmas... ah am sorry! [peasant_1.Custom('GetLaughType')]" the victim covers [peasant_1.GetHerHis] face, deflecting the attack. "Help me, [peasant_3.Custom('FirstName')]! #EMP *hic*#!"\n\n"Yer on yer own 'dere, [peasant_2.Custom('RegName')]!" the last one exclaims, downing an entire mug in one big gulp."

Perhaps you'd like to hear something cheerful, like the tale of when [memory_story.GetThirdPerspectiveDescription]?"
