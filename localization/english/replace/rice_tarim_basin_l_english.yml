 # History Intros (Jesus Christ these are long)
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.zhang: "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Following the Tang Dynasty's decline in the wake of the An Lushan rebellion of the mid-8th century, the Tibetan Empire conquered much of the former Tang dominions in Central Asia, including Dunhuang (or Shazhou). Zhang Yichao, a Han native of Dunhuang, led a successful revolt in 848 against the Tibetans; after years of campaigning, he restored much of the Hexi Corridor to Tang rule.\n\nYichao had a tense relationship with the Tang, and had to send his brother Yitan to the Tang court as a hostage in order to curry favor with them, as he needed every bit of help he could get to defend the frontier. When Yitan passed away, Yichao decided to replace him as hostage, leaving his nephew Huaishen in charge.\n\nHuaishen’s reign was more tumultuous, as a number of his uncle’s gains were lost, and there was little improvement in the Guiyi Circuit's relationship with the Tang. Eventually, Huaishen died under uncertain circumstances around 890. He was probably killed by either one of his relatives, and/or an ambitious official such as Suo Xun."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.cao: "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Though the Cao were a well-established clan in Dunhuang, it is possible their most famous member, Cao Yijin, was actually of distant Sogdian origin. If this is true, he might have wanted to emphasize a connection with the more famous Cao to bolster his immediate family's prestige.\n\nRegardless, Yijin was originally a senior official of Zhang Yichao, the liberator of Dunhuang. He usurped power from the Zhang family by 914, but unlike the coups by other Dunhuang clans, his was more successful and permanent.\n\nYijin inherited a Guiyi greatly reduced in power and size. Nonetheless, he was a capable ruler: he maintained strategic marriage alliances with Kingdom of Khotan and the Uyghurs of Guazhou, working to earn the trust of Dunhuang’s elite clans, developing agriculture, patronizing major Buddhist religious projects, and so on. After he passed away in 935, his family would remain in power until the fall of the Guiyi Circuit to Western Xia in 1036."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.suo: "#emphasis Historical Context:#! The Suo were one of the oldest clans in Dunhuang, descended from a Jin Dynasty scholar and official named Suo Jing (239-303), who is one of the most important figures in the history of Chinese calligraphy.\n\nWith such an illustrious pedigree, the Suo were considered one of the most influential Dunhuang clans - a contemporary source lists the Suo as the first rank among the major Dunhuang families, and many served Zhang Yichao’s as officials or generals. One of them, Suo Zhongxin, was a close attendant of Yichao; another, Suo Xun, was his son-in-law.\n\nYichao’s nephew and successor, Huaishen, died in unusual circumstances in 890. A leading theory for his death is that he was murdered by Suo Xun, perhaps together with Yichao’s son Huaiding, as the two may have shared power for a while until Huaiding’s death. Xun ruled on his own for a couple more years, until he himself was killed in a counter-coup in 894 by the sons of Li Mingzhen, another son-in-law of Yichao.\n\nNonetheless, the Suo continued to play a role in Dunhuang politics. For example, one of their members, the official Suo Ziquan, led a major delegation to the King of Khotan in 956."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.li: "#emphasis Historical Context:#! The Longxi Li were a branch of the Li family based in modern-day Gansu province. Their scions included the famed Han Dynasty general Li Guang, his grandson the tragic traitor Li Ling, and the Tang Dynasty itself. In Dunhuang, they played a major role in the region’s politics for centuries. For example, an ancestor of the Tang Emperors, Li Gao, founded the short-lived Western Liang dynasty that ruled Dunhuang from 400 to 421.\n\nThe Li clan were staunch supporters of Zhang Yichao, the liberator of Dunhuang, and his family. At the time, their foremost representative was Li Mingzhen, a son-in-law of Yichao. He served as Yichao’s envoy to the Tang court at one point, using his alleged shared ancestry with the Tang Emperors to increase his credibility and convince them to give Yichao the coveted title of #italic jiedushi#! or military governor.\n\nMingzhen’s relatives also had key roles in Dunhuang, such as two of his brothers had important posts in the Guiyi Army, one of whom, Mingda, accompanied him during his trip to the Tang court. Meanwhile, after Mingzhen's death in 890, his four sons would launch a counter-coup against Suo Xun and restore the region to Zhang rule."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.zhai: "#emphasis Historical Context:#! The Zhai clan had a presence in Dunhuang by the 6th century. A certain Zhai Tong, styled Siyuan, patronized the construction of Mogao Cave 220 in the year 642 during the early Tang Dynasty. This cave is one of the earliest known caves at Mogao dedicated solely as a family shrine, and one of the few caves that can be dated relatively reliably. Over the course of three hundred years, the cave went through several reconstructions by Siyuan’s descendants.\n\nDuring Zhang Yichao’s rule, a prominent member of the Zhai clan was Zhai Farong, a monk and physician who served as chief of the Buddhist monastic community in the entire Hexi region. A relative of his, Xin (or Huaxin), would later serve the Zhang family as a minor official.\n\nXin’s son was Fengda, a 9th-generation descendant of Siyuan who would become the Zhai clan’s most famous scion. As an important official of the Cao dynasty in the 900s, he was noted for his intellectual pursuits, particularly in astronomy."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.yin: "#emphasis Historical Context:#! The Yin clan were active in Dunhuang since at least the 4th century. During the Former Liang dynasty (320–376), at some point they raised the ire of Former Liang’s founder, Zhang Gui, resulting in the death of a prominent member of the family, Yin Jian. Jian’s brother, Yin Dan, served as governor of Dunhuang at some point as well.\n\nRegardless, the Yin family continued to thrive in Dunhuang over the centuries, involving themselves in the region’s politics. For example, they were stalwart supporters of Empress Wu Zetian during her reign; according to legend, a scion of the Yin family dreamt of various auspicious signs affirming the legitimacy and greatness of her rule.\n\nBy the Guiyi period, they also played a role in assisting Zhang Yichao reclaim Dunhuang from the Tibetans. Yin Wentong, a son-in-law of Yichao, was one of his major generals for example. Another member of the family, Jifeng, would later become governor of Liangzhou."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.zhang_wenche: "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Zhang Wenche was a poet and one of the two officials sent to lead a group of envoys to the Tang Dynasty in 887 CE on behalf of Guiyi's ruler, Zhang Huaishen. The other was Song Runying.\n\nThe envoys’ mission was to ask the Tang to formally bestow on their liege the important title of #italic jiedushi#!, and legitimize his rule in light of the region's deteriorating political situation. When the Tang court dragged their feet about it for weeks, the envoys got into a fight - Runying argued they had to be patient; Wenche argued it was pointless, and he furthermore insulted Huaishen as an inept lord who didn't deserve the title. Either way, the group returned empty handed.\n\nThere is a theory Wenche was the one who actually ordered Huaishen's assassination in 892, and not Suo Xun, who usurped power afterwards. Wenche became prime minister for a later ruler of Guiyi, Huaishen's kinsman Chengfeng, and helped persuade his liege to proclaim himself Emperor in 910 after the fall of the Tang. This failed disastrously when the Uyghurs attacked; a humiliated Chengfeng had to downgrade to a king, before being usurped by Cao Yijin. By then, Wenche had passed away."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.song_runying: "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Song Runying was an official in Guiyi who was one of the two officials sent to lead a group of envoys to the Tang Dynasty in 887 CE on behalf of Guiyi's ruler, Zhang Huaishen. The other was Zhang Wenche.\n\nThe envoys’ mission was to ask the Tang to formally bestow on their liege the important title of #italic jiedushi#!, and legitimize his rule in light of the region's deteriorating political situation.

Either way, the group returned empty handed."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.yan: "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Like many elite clans in Dunhuang, the Yan family were both collaborators and resistors to the Tibetan Empire after it conquered the Hexi Corridor from the Tang.\n\nThis paradoxical relationship can perhaps be seen through the career of the family’s most famous member, the general Yan Chao, who organized major resistance to the Tibetan invasion in the 770s and 780s. With aid from the Tang government not forthcoming, he surrenders to the Tibetans on the condition that Dunhuang was spared from any looting and destruction. The Tibetans likely remained suspicious of Yan Chao, as they poisoned him when he was making his way to formally pay homage to the Tibetan leadership in Lhasa.\n\nYan Yingda, the most prominent member of the clan in Zhang Yichao’s regime, started off as the highest ranking Chinese official under the Tibetans in the early 9th century. He ended up contributing to Zhang Yichao’s uprising, however, and was appointed prefect of Guazhou at some point."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.gao_jinda: "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Gao Jinda was a military commander serving under Zhang Yichao during his uprising against the Tibetans. After the rebellion’s success, Yichao sent Jinda to report the victory to the Tang court. It is uncertain how many delegations Yichao sent and when, but Jinda’s group was likely the first one.\n\nInterestingly, Jinda was accompanied by a small escort of only ten soldiers, despite the dangers they faced along the way. Parts of the Hexi Corridor were still controlled by Tibetan warlords battling in the wake of the Tibetan Empire’s collapse, so Jinda and his team had to use a roundabout route through the desert to reach Tang territory in a journey that took two years.\n\nAlas, their trip must have ended in disappointment, as the Tang court did not appear elated at the news, as they only conferred on Zhang Yichao the relatively worthless title of “Defender of Shazhou,” perhaps as a courtesy acknowledgement of his accomplishments. Yichao would only receive the coveted title of #italic jiedushi#! or military governor when he sent a later team of envoys headed by brother Yitan, the famed monk Wuzhen, and Li Mingzhen, a distant relative of the Tang Emperors."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.sogdian: "#emphasis Historical Context:#! The Sogdians, an East Iranian people famed for their skills in trade, had a major presence in Dunhuang and the Hexi Corridor in the ancient and medieval period. Many rose to prominence in Dunhuang elite society and played a role in the Guiyi Circuit’s government and military.\n\nAn Jingmin, for example, must have been a Sogdian of some importance as he was involved in Zhang Yichao’s uprising and appointed vice-commissioner of the Guiyi Circuit, and thus second in command to Yichao.\n\nThe Kang were another prominent Sogdian family in Dunhuang. Their main representatives in Yichao’s regime included officials such as Kang Tongxin, a magistrate of several towns in the eastern Hexi Corridor, and Kang Shijun, who served as prefect of Guazhou at some point."
 RICE_dunhuang_start_intro.wenmo: "As [ruler|E] of the Wenmo, you start off with some [special_troops|E].\n\n#emphasis Historical Context:#! The Wenmo, also known as the Wamo or Hunmo, have ambiguous origins but are likely the descendants of slaves of Chinese ancestry and other ethnicities in under Tibetans during the Tibetan occupation of the Gansu region.\n\nThe development of the Wenmo identity has been described as analogous to the Creoles or Maroons in the Americas. The Wenmo were a thorn on the side of the Guiyi Circuit, and established an independent regime in Liangzhou by 884.\n\nZhebu Yun here is fictitious, though the Zhebu were a major Wenmo tribe. Their most important member was Zhebu Jiashi, who became leader of Liangzhou in 948-949. In 1004, another Zhebu, Zhebu Youlongbo, surrendered Liangzhou to the rising Tanguts, predecessors of the Western Xia state."

Perhaps such an assessment is a great exaggeration, based on fanciful tales and questionable stereotypes, but there is no doubt that many talented people live in those regions.\n\nAnyways, due to my connections with the local East Asian community, I’ve come into contact with some rather talented individuals with abilities in a wide variety of fields, ranging from poetry to hydraulics, history, agriculture, military logistics, and more. A number have agreed to work for me in my administration."

Normal life is returning to [khotan.GetNameNoTier], as it were.\n\nThe last of the processions is done, and the hustle and bustle in [khotan.GetNameNoTier] has died down.

A long time ago, when the Lord Buddha visited Khotan, he prophesied that it would one day be home to a kingdom where the Dharma would flourish. To ensure it would continue to endure and thrive as a great Buddhist kingdom, the Buddha asked eight deities to protect it. Their names are Aparajita, Samjnaya, Gaganasvara, Suvarnamala, Grhavatapta, Amgusa, Sthanavati, and Vaisravana.\n\nThe presence of these deities can be found everywhere, and it is no different during this time when the annual procession is taking place. From statues and murals on the walls of temples and monasteries that depict these Eight deities, to prayers muttered on the lips of all the city’s pious Buddhists, I sense they are watching over us, even now."
 tarim_basin.0154.a: "It is inspiring, in a way."
 tarim_basin.0155.t: "The Deer of Illumination"
 tarim_basin.0155.desc: "By exploring the religious landscape of [khotan.GetNameNoTier] (especially during the city’s annual procession of images like this), I get to visit some of the city’s fine monasteries. The finest among them is #bold Gomati#!, the city’s royal monastery, which has the capacity to house several thousand monks and whose founding is shrouded in legend.\n\nThus I have heard…. Long ago, there was a king of Khotan named Vijaya Virya, who saw a brilliant light coming from outside one day. He traveled into the wilderness to investigate the source of the light, and found that the light was emanating from a deer. It immediately transformed into the #italic yaksha#! spirit Samjnaya, one of the Eight Protectors of Khotan, who instructed the king to build a monastery there so that he could receive a teaching on the #italic Dharma#! from several #italic arhats#!.\n\nI can only sigh in wonder as I reflect on all the miraculous things that happened here."

 tarim_basin.0156.t: "Vimalaprabha"
 tarim_basin.0156.desc: "During the annual procession of images of [khotan.GetNameNoTier], to inspire themselves to do greater deeds of merit, many people retell stories about the city’s history of pious and virtuous leaders, such as certain kings or monks. While many of them are men, that doesn’t mean there aren’t righteous women to emulate - perhaps the most well-known is Vimalaprabha, whose cult is popular here.\n\nThus I have heard…. Vimalaprabha is in fact a female #italic Bodhisattva#! and protector deity, who wished to be reborn again and again as different women who would help Khotan in its time of need. Most famously, she was once reborn as the Khotanese princess Praniyata, who went into exile when the Tibetans - enemies of Buddhism at the time - conquered and ransacked Khotan. The princess led her people to safety despite the cowardice of her brother the king, and aspired that China would come to Khotan’s aid.\n\nSuch stories tell us clearly that no matter if one is male or female, that anyone can perform meritorious deeds and save others."
 tarim_basin.0156.a: "Vimalaprabha is an inspiration to us all!"
 tarim_basin.0157.t: "Draining of the Lake"
 tarim_basin.0157.desc: "The annual procession of images in [khotan.GetNameNoTier] offers me the opportunity to explore some of the land around the city. It is without a doubt a desert oasis, but it had not always been so, if the legends are to be believed.\n\nThus I have heard…. When Khotan had not been founded yet, and it was still an empty wilderness, the Buddha visited the site of the future city, which had been blessed by the Buddhas of previous eons. At the time, there was nothing but a large lake. The Buddha blessed the area, draining the lake and transforming it all into the beautiful land that is now Khotan.\n\nI have heard several variations of this legend, but the basic points remain. Whether the legend is true or not, few can deny that the city is in an auspicious locale!"
 tarim_basin.0157.a: "After all, that is how it became a religious center."
 tarim_basin.0158.t: "Ashoka's Son"
 tarim_basin.0158.desc: "As the procession of images continues in [khotan.GetNameNoTier], I reflect on some of the city's Buddhist history and legends.\n\nThus I have heard…. Long ago, the city was founded by a certain Kustana, son of Ashoka, the great Buddhist Emperor in India. When a prophecy said the boy would become king during his father's lifetime, Ashoka, fearing his son as a threat, abandoned him in the Tarim Basin. The young child was suckled by an earth-breast, and later adopted by a Chinese king who had prayed to the deity Vaisravana, protector of the Buddhist teachings, for a son. After a series of events, Khotan was settled by Indians and Chinese led by Kustana.\n\nAnyways, this is but one version of the legend about Khotan's founding that I've heard."
 tarim_basin.0158.a: "Who knows if it's true or not?"
 tarim_basin.0159.t: "The Silk Princess"
 tarim_basin.0159.desc: "I am paying a visit to one of several major monasteries in [khotan.GetNameNoTier] during the annual procession of images. I note one of how it depicts a legend concerning the Silk princess and Mashe Monastery, another major monastery. The legend is a popular one, and I have seen it depicted in many monasteries.\n\nThus I have heard…. Centuries ago, a Khotanese king wanted to learn the secret of making silk, but it was tightly guarded by the Chinese authorities. When he married a Chinese princess, he convinced her to help him attain this goal, so she hid mulberry seeds and silkworm eggs in her hair when she crossed the border. Before she arrived in the city of Khotan, she deposited the seeds and eggs at a site that would later become Mashe Monastery.\n\nWho knows if this legend is true! But it is certainly one that many locals find interesting."
 tarim_basin.0159.a: "So I have heard, so I have heard."
 tarim_basin.0160.t: "The Hill of Gautośan"
 tarim_basin.0160.desc: "Spending time in [khotan.GetNameNoTier] during the annual procession of images allows me to better appreciate the city’s religious history and legends. It is said the city’s location has been blessed not only by the Buddha, but by previous, other Buddhas as well according to many stories.\n\nThus I have heard…. In the past, there was a child who got lost near Gomati, the city’s greatest monastery. The concerned king led many people in searching the area for the child, and they stumbled upon a small valley by the hill of Gautośan. They were amazed to discover a #italic stupa#! containing relics of Kasyapa, the last Buddha before the historical Buddha. Recognizing the location’s sacred nature, the King ordered the construction of what is now known as Gautośan monastery.\n\nAs the chief Khotanese monasteries, Gomati and Gautośan are said to be the site of many heavenly signs and miracles, so it's little wonder they have such a wondrous history."
 tarim_basin.0160.a: "It is good they are still here for us to visit in this eon."
 tarim_basin.0161.t: "The Miraculous, Flying Statues"
 tarim_basin.0161.desc: "Stories about miraculous, flying statues are heard everywhere in [khotan.GetNameNoTier], to the point I’m unsure which are false and which are authentic.\n\nThus I have heard…. Because Khotan is in an auspicious land, miraculous statues of Buddhas and other deities are said to fly from India to Khotan from time to time. One of the most notable was the so-called Udayana statue. The young king Udayana was a faithful follower and contemporary of the Buddha, who had a sandalwood statue of the Buddha carved. This statue acquired miraculous abilities, such as bowing to or engaging in dialogue with the Buddha. It eventually flew to a location near Khotan known as Pimo, and to this day, Pimo remains a popular area of pilgrimage for locals.\n\nI am only fortunate that I have found the opportunity to quickly visit Pimo itself during this time."

Legend had it that the Buddha instructed several deities, the so-called Eight Protectors, to stand guard over the city so long as the people stayed true to his teachings. However, one of the core teachings of Buddhism is the idea that all things are impermanent, and [khotan.GetNameNoTier] is no different. It is clear that the Eight Protectors have abandoned the city.\n\nThere are new rulers in [khotan.GetNameNoTier] now, particularly [khotan_new_ruler.Custom('TitledFirstName')].

He also expressed hostility towards Buddhist and pagan beliefs.\n\nAt any rate, Kashgari was supposedly related to the rulers of the Karakhanid dynasty; such a connection is not entirely proven, but it is plausible.

She had her son, [ali_arslan.Custom('FirstName')], with none other than Saint Gabriel.\n\nLater, this brave woman went into battle herself against the infidels, showing that anyone, no matter if they are men or women, can fight in the name of righteousness and justice.

A couple of specialists recently arrived from China to help us maintain the irrigation canals in [ROOT.Char.GetCapitalLocation.GetCounty.GetTitle.GetNameNoTier]. Many of the canals of the [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_dunhuang_region').GetName] are old, some dating back as far as the days of the Han Dynasty, so they are in constant need of repairs."
 tarim_basin.0253.a: "Their expertise is greatly appreciated."
 tarim_basin.0254.t: "Foreign Artists of Serindia"
 tarim_basin.0254.desc: "A number of foreign artists living in the region have banded together to present to me some works of art, as a sign of their support for me.

Though the judges will likely side with me, this situation could get messy."
 tarim_basin.0255.a: "Those things are mine! I refuse to go to court!"
 tarim_basin.0255.b: "They can have those things. I have no need for them."

There could be a great disturbance in the community if they fight."

 tarim_basin.0256.b: "I shouldn't intervene; this is a private matter."

 tarim_basin.0257.desc: "Recently, in the area, there has been a trend of people who are Buddhist monks and nuns on paper, but live normal lives with normal jobs and families in practice. It is clear that many people are doing this as a form of tax evasion, as clergy are not taxed.\n\nI and many of my officials have always been reluctant to do anything about this issue, lest we anger the religious authorities. Yet, this is a growing problem, and I don't want to let it just slide anymore."
 tarim_basin.0257.a: "Ignore their excuses! Enforce the law and fine the violators!"

The monastery's leadership suggests I use some funds to renovate the cave, as it would bring me much merit."

 tarim_basin.0261.b: "The [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] is clearly in the right."
 tarim_basin.0261.c: "This is none of my concern. Begone!"
 tarim_basin.0261.d: "This was merely a misunderstanding, as legally speaking..."

The vegetable known to help with maintaining a good digestive system, per the advice of some doctors who recommended it to me.\n\nRhubarb was first grown in [suzhou.GetNameNoTier] in the [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_dunhuang_region').GetName].

When I came to inspect the cave myself, I have to admit it was very impressive. The statues and paintings were lifelike, and inspired great awe and piety in many present."

 tarim_basin.0265.t: "Silk as a Courtesy Gift"
 tarim_basin.0265.desc: "Given how the Silk Road runs [ROOT.Char.GetCapitalLocation.GetCounty.GetTitle.GetNameNoTier], silk is oftentimes a common method of payment or a common gift.\n\nA family dispute within a prominent clan recently happened under my jurisdiction, which led to a number of disturbances and threats to public order. Even for me, the affair became a huge headache as I tried to get the whole issue resolved.\n\nOnce everything finally settled down, the family agreed to paid me a fine for causing such a ruckus.
