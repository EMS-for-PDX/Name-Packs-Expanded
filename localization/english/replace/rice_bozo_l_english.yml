[ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] funerary traditions dictate that [ROOT.Var('RICE_ghana_burial_ancestor').Char.GetSheHe] should be buried in a large dome of acacia wood, and provided a human sacrifice."

 bozo.0012.desc: "As is our [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] tradition, I have ordered the construction of a large dome, made out of acacia wood, to bury [ROOT.Var('RICE_ghana_burial_ancestor').Char.Custom('FirstName')]. The structure is almost complete, and I am thus making preparations for the burial ceremony.\n\nTypically, we sacrifice servants and slaves alongside [ROOT.Var('RICE_ghana_burial_ancestor').Char.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] in the dome. The [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PriestNeuterPlural] have provided me a list of servants and slaves to sacrifice for the occasion."

I and my entire court accompany [ROOT.Var('RICE_ghana_burial_ancestor').Char.GetHerHis] body as we bring it inside the dome of acacia wood that we have erected. We place the body on a bed with cushions, and surround it with many ornaments, weapons, and utensils, so that [ROOT.Var('RICE_ghana_burial_ancestor').Char.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] can feast and drink in the afterlife.\n\nAfter this, we sacrifice many slaves and servants by immuring them in the tomb. We then cover the dome with mats and curtains, placing as much earth as we can on top of the tomb, so that it becomes a small hill surrounded by a trench.\n\nFollowing this, we sacrifice victims and pour libations of fermented drinks to [ROOT.Var('RICE_ghana_burial_ancestor').Char.Custom('FirstNameNoTooltip')] and our other ancestors."

The girl went to her fate bravely, happy to die for her people.\n\nInterestingly, locals claim to have discovered the girl’s tomb at the new location!
