### Character Assignment ###
############################

#Generally Variables should be applied to characters with a dynasty. For whatever reason dynasty names aren't always set correctly for history files.
#For that reason the variables should be tagged as either _dynasty or _global
#Character id should be assigned their name directly as plain text so loc keys can work.
#Nicknames and such can have their global vars applied through the character so you can use scope:this, it allows everyone to keep track of the bynames for a character.

#Vars
#name_pack_support_dynasty name_pack_support_global - Allows name to be translated
#dynasty_list_ctp_sons global_list_ctp_sons - Assigns that character to be searchable for teknonyms in that dynasty
#regular_laqab_dynasty pre_laqab_dynasty - tells the system to regonize the character as having a laqab
#dynasty_independent - Tags character as an independent ruler but dead
#dynasty_feudalclan dynasty_tribal etc - Tags character as that gov but dead
# (ANY CHARACTER GLOBAL VAR) - These are lists of characters with specific bynames to be displayed
#add_character_flag - These are flags specific to disallow events or decisions
